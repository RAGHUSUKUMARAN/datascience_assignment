I'd lost the White House's deathless prose when I posted (that's what happens
when you read news at home when you're rat-arsed), but I did have a bunch
of follow-ups going on about cellular/cordless comms.  The original article
has reappeared, so:

    The President today announced a new initiative that will bring
    the Federal Government together with industry in a voluntary
    program to improve the security and privacy of telephone
    communications while meeting the legitimate needs of law
    enforcement.

Hmm, telephone communications could indeed include end-to-end encryption on
ordinary landlines.

    The initiative will involve the creation of new products to
    accelerate the development and use of advanced and secure
    telecommunications networks and wireless communications links.

But the next paragraph says telecoms networks and wireless communications
links.

OK, it's far from clear exactly what Cripple (what an apposite anagram) will
be applied to, but the reason Joe Public wants secure comms is to stop
people listening in to his cellular or cordless phones (and he wouldn't
even be bothered about that were it not for Wingnut and Squidqy's
misfortunes).

Yes, Cripple *might* be for end-to-end encyption, dropping to clear
when the other end doesn't have Cripple.  But then a cordless-to-ordinary
conversation would be in clear leaving the cordless end just as vulnerable
as at present.  Nope, I suspect that Cripple will only be used on radio
links.

OK, it's possible `telecommunications networks' could mean `ordinary phone
lines', but I'm betting it means the microwave links used by the telcos.

My apologies if I'm wrong, particularly if the turgid Press Release makes it
clear that I'm wrong and I missed it, but as far as I can see it was full of
obfuscation, and anyone expecting end-to-end encryption is in for a surprise
(IMHO).


BTW, Graham, I've posted questions to alt.security.pgp and not seen any
replies/followups from outside Europe - how about you?  Have I made it into
everyone's kill file, or is there some problem?

I attribute my success to several factors:

Very low fat.  Except when someone else has cooked a meal for me,
I only eat fruit, vegetables, and whole grain or bran cereals.  I
estimate I only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat.

Very little sugar or salt.

Very high fiber.  Most Americans get about 10 grams.  25 to 35 are
recommended.  I get between 50 and 150.  Sometimes 200.  (I've heard
of people taking fiber pills.  It seems unlikely that pills can
contain enough fiber to make a difference.  It would be about as
likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills.  Tablets are
just too small, unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily.)

My ""clean your plate"" conditioning works *for* me.  Eating the last
10% takes half my eating time, and gives satiety a chance to catch
up, so I don't still feel hungry and go start eating something else.

I don't eat when I'm not hungry (unless I'm sure I'll get hungry
shortly, and eating won't be practical then).

I bike to work, 22 miles a day, year round.  Fast.  I also bike to
stores, movies, and everywhere else, as I've never owned a car.
I estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day.  It also helps
build and maintain muscle mass, prevent insulin resistance (diabetes
runs in my family), and increase my metabolism.  (Even so, my
metabolism is so low that when I'm at rest I'm most comfortable
with a temperature in the 90s (F), and usually wear a sweater if
it drops to 80.)  Cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess
ounce.  (Cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that
weigh slightly less than others.  But it's easier and cheaper to trim
weight from the rider than from the vehicle.)

There's no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically
different from that of most people who have never been fat.  Fortunately,
it isn't different in a way that precludes excellent health.

Obviously, I can't swear that every obese person who does what I've
done will have the success I did.  But I've never yet heard of one who
did try it and didn't succeed.

> I think all of us cycle.  One's success depends on how large the

I'm sure everyone's weight cycles, whether or not they've ever been fat.
I usually eat extremely little salt.  When I do eat something salty,
my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds.  It comes
off again over a week or two.

There are basically three alternatives for Gaza:

1.  To throw the Jews to the sea. that is basically to make them leave
   the Middle-East and go back to where they came from (russia, Europe, USA, etc)
2.  To throw the Gazans into the sea, in accordance with Yitzhak Rabin's
     wish and that of many Zionists.
3.  For Israelis and Palestinians to come to an honorable and fair (I
   don't attempt to say just) settlement, which would allow each person
   to live in dignity in his country in freedom and equality.

I personnaly opt for the third alternative. How about you folks ?

>     Do the words ""Question Authority"" mean anything to you?
>
>     I defy any theist to reply.      

Well, despite what my mother told me about accepting dares, here goes.
 
You have to be very careful about what you mean by ""question authority"".
Taken literally, it is nonsense. That which is authoratative is authoratative,
and to say ""I question to word of this authority"" is ridiculous. If it is 
open to question, it isn't an authority. On the other hand, it is perfectly
reasonable to question whether something is an authority. The catch phrase
here should be ""authenticate authority."" Once you have authenticated
your authority, you must believe what it says, or you are not treating it as
an authority. 

The difficulty is that authenticating an authority is not easy. You 
can perhaps discredit a claim to authority by showing logical inconsistency
in what it teaches, or by showing that it does not obey its own rules of
discourse. But the fact that I cannot discredit something does not, in
inself, accredit it. (Nor does the fact that I can convince myself and 
other that I have discredited something necessarilly mean that it is false.)
I cannot accredit an authority by independantly verifying its teachings, 
because if I can independantly verify its teachings, I don't need an 
authority. I need an authority only when there is information I need which
I cannot get for myself. Thus, if I am to authenticate an authority, I must
do it by some means other than by examining its teachings. 

In practical matters we accept all kinds of authorities because we don't
have time to rediscover fundamental knowledge for ourselves. Every scientist
woring today assumes, on the authority of the scintific community, all sorts
of knowledge which is necessary to his work but which he has not time to 
verify for himself.

In spiritual matters, we accept authority because we have no direct source 
ofinformation. We select our authorities based on various criteria. (I am
a Catholic, in part, because the historical claims of the RC church seem
the strongest.) Without authorities there would be no subject matter for
belief, unless we simply made something up for ourselves (as many do).

The atheist position seems to be that there are no authorities. This is a
reasonable assertion in itself, but it leads to a practical difficulty.
If you reject all authority out of hand, you reject all possibility of
every receiving information. Thus the atheist position can never possibly
change. It is non-falsifiable and therefore unscintific. 

To demand scintific or rational proof of God's existence, is to deny
God's existence, since neither science, nor reason, can, in their very
nature, prove anything.

Okay, this is a long shot.

My friend Robin has recurring bouts of mononucleosis-type symptoms, very  
regularly.  This has been going on for a number of years.  She's seen a  
number of doctors; six was the last count, I think.  Most of them have  
said either ""You have mono"" or ""You're full of it; there's nothing wrong  
with you.""  One has admitted to having no idea what was wrong with her,  
and one has claimed that it is Epstein-Barr syndrome.

Now, what she told me about EBS is that very few doctors even believe that  
it exists.  (Obviously, this has been her experience.)  So, what's the  
story?  Is it real?  Does the medical profession believe it to be real?

Has anyone had success is treating EBS?  Or is it just something to live  
with?  Thanks for your assistance.

I had the same inconvenience when I bought my EX-500; only I could at least
go 50 mph during the initial break-in.

Despite the high quality of motor oils and motorcycle engines these days,
I would follow the instructions, and just keep to city street riding for
the first 500 miles. Heck, those miles go by fast, and it's worth it to
know you haven't possibly screwed up your engine.

At the same time, this has all the makings of a 6-week-long thread debating
the whole break-in topic.

Any state that the CIA does not control is called ""state that is linked

Meanwhile Even Egyptian ""experts"" who hate The Islamic movement admit

Can anybody see any contradiction between the above and the first

When it comes to Egypt, all human rights, ethics, principles can

Off the top of my head, I might try:

Given: p_1, p_2, p_3, p_4

Find:  p_c (center of sphere determined by p_1, ..., p_4), 
       dist(p_c, p_i) (radius)

p_c is the same distance from our four points, so
dist(p_c,p_1) = dist(p_c,p_2) = dist(p_c,p_3) = dist(p_c,p_4) 

Of course, we can square the whole thing to get rid of square roots:
distsq(p_c,p_1) = distsq(p_c,p_2) = distsq(p_c,p_3) = distsq(p_c,p_4) 

Plug in the variables into the distance formula, simplify, and the 
x^2_c, y^2_c, and z^2_c terms cancel out, leaving you with three 
linearly independent equations and three unknowns (x_c, y_c, z_c).  
Solve using your favorite method.  :)


All the best,

       If you happen to know a political position which does not
have people advocating it who do more harm than good, please point it
out.

       One of the advantages and draw-backs of requiring proof
on the part of the government before they may take action against
citizens.  (and part of the reason some of us believe weapons should
be available.)

       We are not arguing the absolute sanctity of the U.S.
Constitution.  In fact, the fillibuster we're talking about isn't
*in* the Constitution.  I objected to your suggestion that the Senate
wasn't intended to exercise the power it was clearly given.

       I'll point out again that Reagan only had a Republican Majority
in the Senate during his first term, and his coalition in the House
came apart at about the same time.  Bush never had any real support in
Congress.

       The real point is that everybody, *everywhere* got their pork,
from the big corporations to the guy I saw last night leaving a
convenience store with an armful of junk-food he'd bought with
food stamps.  (He spent more in food stamps on junk than I *make* in a week
and I'm not on government assitance.)

>Money was diverted from programs addressing
>social needs and poured into the weapons industry in the form of cost
>plus profits contracts. 

       Lessee, let's pull out the old Almanac.

       In 1980, total U.S. government budget outlays were 590.9 billion
dollars.  In 1992 (est) they were 1.4754 trillion dollars, an increase of
approx. 884 billion dollars.

       In 1980, National Defense cost 133.9 billion dollars.  In
192 it was 307 billion dollars, and increase of 174 billion dollars.
That leaves an increase of 710 billion dollars unaccounted
for.  (This represented an increase of 230%)

       In 1980, Income Security (which includes retirement programs,
Housing Assitance, and unemployment benefits, and I believe welfare)
cost 86.5 billion dollars.  In 1992 it was 198 billion dollars, or
more than national defense started.  (This represented an increase
of 230%)

       In 1980, the Federal Government spent 32 billion dollars on
Medicare.  In 1992 they spent 118 billion dollars.  (an increase of
368%)

       In 1980, the Feds spent 9 billion dollars on housing
credits and subsidies of that like.  In 1992 it was 87 billion.

       In 1980, Health care services and research was 23 billion
dollars.  In 1992, it was 94 billion dollars.

       Agriculture, up 9 billion to 17 billion.

       Science, up 11 billion to 16 billion.

       Resource conservation up 7 billion to 20 billion.

       Education up 14 billion to 45 billion.

       Veteran benefits up 12 billion to 33 billion.

       Trasnportation up 13 billion to 34 billion.
     
       About the only things I see which was seriously decreased was under 
the Energy category, primarily under ""Supply,"" and ""Community Development,""
in the area of ""disaster relief,"" and between the two of them
represent a loss of less than 11 billion dollars.

       Where *was* this huge diversion?

>In order to rectify this situation there must
>be constitutional revision.

       Not that's a stretch.  If the current government was pushed by
the President to create this mess, wouldn't one expect it to begin to
equalize once the pressure is gone?

>Secondly the form of this revision must take account of the changed 
>circumsatnces of the role of the Federal government. 

       Only assuming that the new role is a positive role we want
to continue. I see very little positive about it.

>The constitution
>cannot be used to frustrate the democratic process. 

       The Constitution was *designed* to frustrate the democratic
process, so that the voters could be absolutely sure they were getting
what they wanted by the time it happened.  Nor do I see putting the
brakes on the ""democratic process"" an inherently bad thing.  Califronia's
riding the edge and every time they pull their ballot initiative nonsense
it gets worse.

>If the peoplr want
>to have welfare spending by the federal government they will have

       Sometimes, or perhaps most of the time, the people should be
told, ""no,"" and pointed to their local government.       

>Attempting to prevent this through constitutional trickery only

       Phill, would you do me the very great favor of repeating that
in talk.politics.guns?

       Cute.  We can eliminate violations of the law by eliminating
the law.

       Free speech alone is dangerous, Phill.

       OK, Phill.  All you gotta show me is a clear pattern of
*reduction* in homicide rates across several countries and that'll
be it.  (Not current, mind, you, reduction.)

        Who's chaining anything to freedom of speech?  By *calling*

       Phill, you're a master of subtly changing the subject.  I haven't
*based* my argument against raw democracy on the Constitution.  I've
tried to explain why it isn't a good idea.  The only time I've referred
to the Constitution is to point out it doesn't contain the restrictions
on the veto and the Senate you appear to believe were ""meant,"" but
just didn't make it in there.
     
       The Constitution doesn't *contain* the 41% fillibuster rule.
I only believe that the rule is a good idea.  You cn't dismiss that
as venerating the Constitution because it isn't *in* the Constitution.

If I remember correctly (Which is always in doubt), Horner's signing
with the Braves was contingent on starting in Atlanta.  I think
he could have gone back to Arizona St. for one more year if he hadn't
signed.  Anyhow, the Braves did try to send him to Richmond once;
it lead to a week-long walkout.  Methinks Horner had no work ethic
before he was drafted, and minor league play wouldn't have helped.
But his raw talent would have gotten him into the ML, and it did
keep him there for a while, until he started falling on his wrists.

This question is, to me, like asking ""Why use SCSI at all?""

- Due to the rather primitive standard DMA solution (which is used by almost all
  floppy interfaces) of PCs, the speed is limited to approx 500 Kbytes/s. 
  I want a standard allowing higher performance.

- With SCSI, the OS can issue a request to the disk and then go ahead with other
  things. Later, when the controller has performed the search and physical read,
  data can be transferred to main memory at ""RAM speeds"". Not very relevant with
  MS-DOS, but MS-DOS is not made for the future.

- I've *got* a SCSI interface. I've got a 5.25"" and a 3.5"" floppy, too, and I am
  not going to throw them out. With SCSI I may add, for all practical purposes,
  an ""unlimited"" number of disk units without sacrificing any of my old disks. 

- For my PC, I've got a 300 Mbyte SCSI disk adopted from a SUN machine, and I
  can carry it over to a Mac, a Sparcstation, an Alpha machine... whatever I like
  to, if I decide to turn my back to the PC. (I *do* know that I cannot expect
  to move the data without reformatting!)

There are probably numerous other reasons for SCSI as well.

>After all it is a floppy replacement we are taking about. 128Mb isnt all that
>much, so it isnt going to replace the need of a fast fixed disk.

No, not replace, but supplement. And contrary to a floppy, a MD may be fast enough
to run programs (or access data) directly off the MD. So we'll have much higher
expectations/demands, which is much better supported by SCSI than the old floppy
interface. And the price of SCSI controllers is not that high any more - isn't it
something like a dozen large pizzas, nowadays? :-)

The HC711 is an EPROM version of the HC11. Raw HC11 parts have factory set
ROM images, and as such are useless to the hobbyist. HC811 parts have
EEPROM, allowing for electrical erasure and reprogramming.

Some Motorola parts (such as the HC705K1) have EPROM, making them user
programmable, but come with options of either windowed or sealed. The
more expensive windowed packages allow multiple use, the plastic dip
varieties are one-time programmable, since there is no way of exposing
the EPROM array to light.

Try peeling the skin back at the base of your other fingernails

What is happening is this:
1) You turn the TV on.
2) The horizontal output begins normal operation.  This powers up the
   high voltage and most of the rest of the circuitry.
3) A problem is sensed and the horizontal oscillator shuts down.
4) After it powers down the cycle repeats.

Things to check:
First check for a shorted high power component.  Your best bet is the vertical
output transistor(s) or, if there is one, the voltage regulator.  The most
common cause of this type of failure is too much current being drawn
somewhere.
Also look for shutdown circuits (which your TV may or may not have),
if you can find one that is shutting down the horizontal oscillator
then it shouldn't be too hard to find the problem from there.

Ok lets have some calculation here: Going by Australian standards, which I 
presume might be similar to other countries ( If not, lets have some 
input) a phone uses 600ohm to loop a 48V line = 80mA. A standard LED 
drains 20mA. So what is the actual loop current required for an ""off hook"" 
indication, do you know?

Hi,
I need your help with a problem I have with a 1989 Mitsubishi
Galant GS transmission.  The car has a 5 speed manual tranmission.
Since the car was bought new, while shifting from 2nd to 3rd,  unless 
I do it SLOWLY and carefully, it makes a ""popping"" or ""hitting"" sound.
The dealer and Mitsubishi customer service (reached by an 800 #) say 
this is NORMAL for the car.  IS IT?
And about a year ago, at 35Kmiles, the stick shift handle got STUCK
while attempting to put it in reverse:
   1- The shifter would not budge.  The clutch had no effect.
   2- The front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is
      fully depressed.
   3- If the clutch is released the engine would die.
   4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was
      stuck, I could not make the car move.  It acted as if
      it were in Neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.)
   5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having 
      someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch),
      while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter.
   6- The shifter acted normally after that.

When this happened, I took it to the dealer, they checked the 
clutch, it was o.k. They checked the transmission, it was o.k.

I had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again last
week.  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because 
Mitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of the
problem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while
they had the car.  
In all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage,
and since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towed
to the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarily
solving the problem).  And the dealer, and Mitsubishi, refused to
send someone to check the car while it was stuck. 
I KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission (shifting 
from 2nd to 3rd), and getting stuck at random, but I can't get 
the dealer to fix it. I need your help with the mechanical problems, 
and with how to handle Mitsubishi.  
All hints and suggestions are greatly appreciated, and sorry to
bore you with the long post.

Thanks,
Rabih.

  While Atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation, I feel that their
relief staff may be suspect.  They don't have a real closer -- although
Mike Stanton (4 saves) has been used in that role.  Didn't Stanton start off
great last year and then falter?  Despite this, your point is well taken.
Atlanta doesn't seem to have the same personality as a NY team, thus is 
unlikely to self-destruct.  For Houston to take 'em, Atlanta needs to
suffer some injuries, particularly to their starting rotation.

  From what I understand, Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the
club.  Houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of
players..  Art  Doug Jones is the key to Houston's success.  He must have
another great year for Houston to challenge in the NL West.

      Right!  A strong rotation will take the pressure off of the troubling
      bullpen.

      The unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the
      club so far.  Biggio and Finley just aren't doing their job of getting
      on base.  Instead of filling his role as an RBI man, Bagwell has had to
      assume Biggio and Finley's job.  Biggio concerns me, since he usually
      starts the season very strong.


                                * * * * * *

     On a side note, are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning
next year's uniform?  There is talk that their road uniform will be
(blech..) traditional grey, with the word ""HOUSTON"" written across the
chest.  If I'm not mistaken, their home uniforms may totally eliminate
the color orange (shiver..).  McLane's favorite color is red, so...
     I'm really upset.. the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound
horrible.  I'd like to see the uniform of the mid-1980s return.  They
may not have been pretty, but Houston had established a long precident of
wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball -- and I liked it.

Just to throw it out there:  The mass of the telescope is 11,600 kg 
(25,500 lb).  I do not know what Space lab weighs, but I believe it is
less.  Can anyone verify??

Also, remember that weight was not the only concern, as many others have 
noted, just one possible concern.  I was responding to a statement that
if you can boost it, why can't you land it.  Those are too different
problems.

There is a perfectly legal tool available to reset the Bimmer service lights.
It will cost you 45$ from a mailorder, and buying one far outweighs
the possible consequences of destroying all the electronics if you try
di it yourself. 
You wonder how people do an oil change without knowing how it reset.
Why is reseting so important? The only reason for doing
it is stop the annoyance of a red light staring at you. 
Forget this 'in european cars you only need to change the oil every
15000' crap. Anyone serious about keeping their engine in good shape, and
extending its life, will change it every 3000, (inc filter). Don't wait
for the servive lights to come on before servicing the car. 
I bought a bmw about 6 months ago, it had 3 green lights on. I have changed
the oil every 3000, completly flushed brake fliud, changed all filters(oil,
air and fuel, changed transmission and drive oils
and done almost all of the other things req for service 1
and a service 2. After nearly 6000 miles, I am still on 2 green lights.
After a winter in Burlington (and it is snowing today!!) that is not bad.

Good luck!

I take it that when something happens that is wrong it's okay if
a bunch of people say it is?  For instance, if some people go on a
murderous rampage and lynch some blacks and then a poll is taken which
shows that the majority of people think that this is acceptable then
does this mean that what these people have done isn't bad?  This is an
example of mob rule not a democracy---a democracy in which people's
rights are protected.  I hope that I've made myself clear on this.

Oh, yeah?  Well---*I* know of ....

Anyways, cannibalism is much more commmon than those who feel that it is wrong
(and then point out that the fact that western civilisation doesn't do it is
PROOF positive that we are more advanced) would have us believe.  Cannibalism
is often used in funeral ceremonies as a way of keeping the deceased loved one
alive.  Many other cultures (including many American Indian cultures) eat/ate
the flesh of slain enemies, often as a way of showing respect for the valor of
the departed.  Hearts are often favored for this, as it contains the spirit.

Have you ever read or seen ""Alive"", which is the story of the Argentinian boys
soccer team that crashed in the Andes and then ate the bodies of those who died
in order to survive?  Finger lickin good.  How about the Twighlight Zone
episode ""To Serve Man""?

If you want more info on this, a good place to start is on sci.anthropology

Now send me $20 and eat my flesh,

I'm looking for algorithms or articles on virtual sound. What i want to do is
the following;

From a fast source, eg. a CDROM, several sound sources are read, each having
it's own defined position and other attributes, eg. direction etc.  Given the
listeners position and direction, the sum of sound played back in each of the
listeners earphones will be a function of this position and direction.  This
means that some simulation of the ears coloring of sound relative to it's
incoming direction have to be done for each sound source.  (I think this is
possible to do with a lookup table of impulse responses for several angles
relative to each ear, and interpolate an impulse function from this for a given
angle.  This impulse function could then be convoluted with the sound from the
source.  This impulse function must be changed every time some sound source
changes position or the listener changes orientation.)  Additionally some
reflection, diffusion and absorbtion due to the environment wich is defined
could be simulated, but this requires some sort of sound propagandation
simulation, kinda like some radiosity algorithm.  

Have someone done this and/or written articles on implementing such a system? 

Please post or mail any answers or comments.

Could someone just collect all the articles from this one, and simply

Well, I have a different story to recount.  I attempted to low-level format a
WD 43MB disk about a year ago.  When I understood my error, I contacted WD.
They told me that I hadn't hurt the drive and that I should just run FDISK and
FORMAT/S on it.  It was fine.  Also, I understand that Western Digital's BBS
may have some low-level formatting routines specifically available for IDE
drives.  You probably need to talk to them and get the straight scoop.

I think you mean the ethernet numbers.  The 8 byte ethernet id is the unique
Electronic Serial Number (ESN) assigned to each ethernet board in existence.
This is a ""physical layer"" concept.  The IP address is a higher layer protocol.
The analogy to telephone service is the IP address is your phone number, while
the particular wire pair in the cable on the pole has some (unknown to you or
I) physical identification scheme (number).

But to answer your question (assuming you indeed meant the Ethernet number)
it is not supposed to be possible to change the number.  Of course the
manufacturer can always retro-fit a board, but there could hardly be a
reason to ever do that.

If your question is actually referring to the IP address, it is most definetly
changable.  But it is strictly software.

You're using drivers version 2.02 or earlier. The latest is 2.03, available
from their BBS or by snailmail. It at least fixes the WfW problem.

The reason I wanted to reply in public instead of private mail is because
of following: I talked to their tech support a few days ago and was told
that I can expect a new version near the end of the month. Which should be
about now...

However, I have a problem when switching back from a DOS session in standard
mode. Apparently they don't know of this problem and seem to be surprised
why anybody would want to use standard mode at all.


It's a great card for the price, at least when I bought it. Now there may be
better alternatives.

Well now that the hawks have won the division the road is a little
easier for the playoffs. Let toronto and detroit beat the hell out of
each other while Chicago sweeps st.louis. That just makes it easier in
the second round with all the rest they will get and tor/det getting
none. For the conf. champ they will have a hard time versus the division
but that div. will be pretty battered also so the advantage goes to the
Hawks again. Then bring pitt. and sure the Hawks will probably lose but
its better to get that far and lose than to not go.

Fear doesn't usually follow reason.  By the way, why do you call
Koresh ""prophet""?  Do you also believe in him?  Personally, I think
he's just some wierdo.

	Yes, there are still alot of MGBs out there.  The earlier cars (pre
 74-1/2) are usually more desirable due to certain things that went with having 
chrome bumpers (ride height, generally more power).  The older cars are 
appreciating... slowly.  The newer ones seem to be at a stable level at the 
moment.  $6 to $8k would require extremely good condition and low miles.
If the car is in good shape and regular maintenance is kept up on it, the car 
should last for a long time.  There are still plenty of parts sources ouththere. 
 The MGB is a great, fun little car.  If she is keeping it solely in the hopes 
that it is going to appreciate, tell her to sell it.  It is not worth waiting 
the time it would take to appreciate to a real profitable level.

There were an assortment of firmware problems, but that is pretty much
expected with any FAX/modem talking with a different FAX or modem
which may have also been revised or is new.  I'm pretty much
oblivious to any current firmware problems, so you'll have to get it
from someone else.

However, I can tell you to stay clear of any board which uses the
Rockwell MPU (as opposed to the DPU) for an internal implementation.
This is because the MPU used ""speed buffering"" instead of having a
16550 interface.  Without the 550 interface, the number of interrupts
are still the same and thus may get dropped under multitasking
conditions (like in windows).  As far as I know, the ""speed buffering""
works OK for external modems if a 550 is used on the internal serial
port board.

Hope this helps...
Tom

Since one is also unlikely to get ""the truth"" from either Arab or 
Palestinian news outlets, where do we go to ""understand"", to learn? 
Is one form of propoganda more reliable than another? The only way 
to determine that is to try and get beyond the writer's ""political

Sigh, I was waiting some some not-so-intelligent person to bring this

that many seem to think is of little importance:

 4th Amendment
 The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, 
 papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, 
 shall not be violated; and no warrants shall issue, but upon 
 probable cause, supported by oath or affirmation, and 
 particularly describing the place to be searched and the persons 
 or things to be seized. 

No, a no-knock warrant is in clear violation of the 4th amendment.
Okay, what about the fact that they were tipped off - they shouldn't
have opened fire - right?  WRONG!  Think about this: I am a drug
dealer and my competition wants to do away with me. They call me and
tell me that the Feds are on their way with a no-knock warrant. So,
being moronic sheep we wait, with our guns holstered. Now, instead of
the Feds, in comes my competition, and we're history.  The only
acceptable answer to a no-knock warrant is blazing guns!  I may sound
paranoid, but our government is out of control, and killing a few
federal officers make knock some sense back into it.

Actually this stuff from Mogilny doesn't surprise me all that much.  About 4
or 5 weeks ago I read in the Toronto Sun a quote from Alex; it went something
like [sarcastically]:

""Yep, Patty's the man.  He's responsible for the team's success...I'm a

I was going to post it at the time...I must have forgot since nobody else 
was talking about him being a problem.

Yep, I'd beat the shit out of him too.  LaFontaine really must be a team
player...makes you wonder what the Islander management was thinking.
My question is what the hell is Muckler doing?  Whether he wishes to admit it
or not, the team is his to coach, and if he can't do the job then maybe the
job should be given to somebody who can.  

Gee, kinda like Alex's spot on the team, isn't it?

I'm writing a mail management system using Word for Windows 2.0 as
a front end. The user dials up a remote system and downloads a batch
of mail as ""foo.txt ."" I've set up an AutoExec macro in Winword to load
""foo.txt"" OK, but subsequent invocations of the macro will of course
pose file name contention problems.

What I'd really like to do is to create an AutoExit macro in Winword
that would move ""foo.txt"" to a specified directory, rename it using
the current date and time, and delete the original ""foo.txt .""

In other words, ""foo.txt"" gets renamed as ""5012300"", say, on May 1
at 23:00- the user gets a time-indexed backup of his mail files and
""foo.txt"" is freed up for the next packet of mail, since my AutoExec
macro points to it.

My main question is this: 

How may one rename a file from within a WordBasic macro to include a 
time/date variable in the new filename?

One of the responsibilities of a licensed physician is to read the medical 
literature to keep up with changes in medical practice.  All the clamor 
over laetril resulted in the NCI spending quite a bit of money on clinical 
trials which proved(to me anyway) that laetril was ineffective against 
cancer.  A physician who continued to use it, when better, more effective, 
treatments are available, may deserve to be called a quack.  Anti-fungals 
are in a different class.  The big question seems to be is it reasonable to 
use them in patients with GI distress or sinus problems that *could* be due 
to candida blooms following the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics?  Gorden 
Rubenfeld, through e-mail, has assured me that most physicians recognize 
the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad-spectrum antibiotic use 
and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with *good* bacteria to 
restore competetion for candida in the body.  I do not believe that this is 
yet a standard part of medical practice.  He deals with critical care 
patients where fungal infection(systemic) is a real problem and just 
because he tries to keep *good* bacteria in his patients does not mean that 
all physicians do this.  I think that aspergillis is more likely to be 
found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida.  Women have been known 
for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a 
women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and 
not give give her advise to use the OTC anti-fungal creams.  Since candida 
colonizes primarily in the ano-rectal area, GI symptoms should be more common 
than vaginal problems after broad-spectrum antibiotic use.

The problem we have here David is proof that GI discomfort can be caused by 
a candida bloom.  The arguement is that without proof, no action is 
warrented.

Medicine has not, and probalby never will be, practiced this way.  There 
has always been the use of conventional wisdom.  A very good example is 
kidney stones.  Conventional wisdom(because clinical trails have not been 
done to come up with an effective prevention), was that restricitng the 
intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones 
from forming.  Clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to 
breakdown the stone once it formed.  Through the recent New England J of 
Medicine article, we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong, 
increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is 
restricting calcium intake.

The conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to 
be reinnoculated with *good* bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy.
If it makes sense for livestock, why doesn't it make sense for humans 
David?  We are not talking about a dangerous treatment(unless you consider 
yogurt dangerous).  If this were a standard part of medical practice, as 
Gordon R. says it is, then the incidence of GI distress and vaginal yeast 
infections should decline.

                      Yigal et al, sue ADL
 
  Nineteen people, including the son off ormer Israeli Defence Minister Moshe 
 Arens, sued the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) on Wednesday, accusing the 
 Jewish group of disclosing confidential official information about them.
 
     Richard Hirschhaut, director of the San Francisco branch of the ADL, art
 dealer Roy Bullock and former policeman Tom Gerard were also named as
 defendants in the suit, filed in San Francisco County Superior Court.
 
     The 19 accuse the ADL of B'nai B'rith, a group dedicated to fighting
 anti-Semitism, and the other defendants of secretly gathering information on
 them, including data from state and federal agencies.
 
     The suit alleges they disclosed the information to others, including the
 governments of Israel and South Africa, in what it alleges was a ``a massive
 spying operation.''
 
     The action is a class-action suit. It was filed on behalf of about 12,000
 anti-apartheid activists or opponents of Israeli policies about whom the
 plaintiffs believe the ADL, Bullock and Gerard gathered information.
 
     Representatives of the ADL in San Francisco were not immediately 
 available for comment on Wednesday.
 
     The civil suit is the first legal action arising out of allegations that
 Gerard, a former inspector in the San Francisco police intelligence unit,
 passed confidential police files on California political activists to a spy
 ring.
 
     The FBI and San Francisco police are investigating the ADL, Bullock and
 Gerard over the affair and last week searched the ADL's offices in San
 Francisco and Los Angeles.
 
     The suit alleges invasion of privacy under the Civil Code of California,
 which prohibits the publication of information obtained from official 
 sources.  It seeks exemplary damages of at least $2,500 per person as well as 
 other unspecified damages.
     
 Lawyer Pete McCloskey, a former Congresmen who is representing the
 plaintiffs, said the 19 plaintiffs included Arab-Americans and Jews -- and 
 his wife Helen, who also had information gathered about her.
 
     One of the plaintiffs is Yigal Arens, a research scientist at the
 University of Southern California who is a son of the former Israeli Defence
 Minister.
 
     Arens told the San Francisco Examiner he had seen a file the ADL kept on
 him in the 1980s, presumably because of his criticism of the treatment of
 Palestinians and his position on the Israeli-occupied territories.
 
     According to court documents released last week, Bullock and Gerard both
 kept information on thousands of California political activists.
 
     In the documents, a police investigator said he believed the ADL paid
 Bullock for many years to provide information and that both the league and
 Bullock received confidential information from the authorities.
 
     No criminal charges have yet been filed in the case. The ADL, Bullock and
 Gerard have all denied any wrongdoing.

Splitfires work mainly by providing a more-or-less unshrouded spark to the
combustion chamber. If an engine's cylinder head design can benefit from this,
then the splitfires will yield a slight performance increase, most noticeably
in lower rpm range torque. Splitfires didn't do diddly-squat for my 1992 GMC
pickup (4.3l V6) but do give a noticeable performance boost in my 1991 Harley
Sportster 1200 and my best friend's 1986 Sportster 883. Folks I know who've
tried them in 1340 Evo motors can't tell any performance boost over plain
plugs (which is interesting since the XLH and big twin EVO combustion chambers
are pretty much the same shape, just different sizes). Two of my friends who
have shovelhead Harleys swear by the splitfires but if I had a shovelhead,
I'd dual-plug it instead since they respond well enough to dual plugs to make
the machine work and extra ignition system worth the expense (plus they look
really cool with a spark plug on each side of each head)

                            PRESS BRIEFING
                           BY DEE DEE MYERS


                          The Briefing Room


10:35 A.M. EDT
	     
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  At 1:00 p.m., we're having a press 
conference, Bill, in the East Room.  And then Saturday the President 
will leave here at roughly 8:00 a.m. and fly down to Jamestown.  He 
will spend the day there, overnight at Camp David. 
	     
	     On Sunday, it's unclear exactly what time he'll leave 
Camp David and fly to Boston.  He'll leave from Hagerstown. The press 
plane will leave from Washington. 
	     
	     He will meet with some --
	     
	     Q	  What kind of a plane is that he's taking?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  That he's taking?  He'll probably take a C-
20.
	     
	     Q	  From Hagerstown?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  From Hagerstown.  Air Force One doesn't fly 
out of Hagerstown, apparently.
	     
	     Q	  How will the pool travel?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The pool will have to meet him ahead of 
time.  So I guess the pool will travel with the press plane and wait 
for him at the airport.  There is currently no provision -- and I'll 
double-check, because there's currently no provision -- I think 
that's standard operating practice.
	     
	     Q	  The pool is not going to meet him and watch him get 
on the plane at Hagerstown?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.
	     
	     Q	  What time does he have to be in Boston?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He's going to meet there with a group of 
citizens, mostly people who supported us during the campaign, at 
around 1:30 p.m.  We're still working out the final times.
	     
	     Q	  At the airport?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, it will be at the Boston Harbor Hotel.  
	     And then he will also meet with some -- a youth group 
that authored something called Project 21.  The speech to the 
publishers is actually at 3:15 p.m.  It will be followed by Q&A.  And 
then after the speech and Q&A, he'll attend a reception with the 
publishers, and then return to Washington from Boston.  And that's it 
for the weekend.
	     
	     Q	  Has the President seen the report from -- or the 
letter, communication from the foreign service officers; also, 
obviously, the communication from Madeleine Albright?  And what is 
his reaction to their call on him?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, obviously, the letter was written to 
Secretary Christopher.  I believe Secretary Christopher received the 
letter on Saturday.  He reviewed it and met with the authors on 
Monday to discuss their views.  He believes it's an important part of 
the policy-making process and is taking their views into account as 
we go forward in the development of the Bosnia policy.
	     
	     Q	  What is the President's reaction?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The President hasn't seen the letter.  It 
was something that was directed towards Secretary Christopher.  In 
terms of -- he hasn't seen specifically the letter, but in terms of 
their concerns generally, what the President has said is that there 
are a lot of options on the table now, including ones that weren't 
there before.  And I think he's, as is everybody, gravely concerned 
about the situation in Bosnia.
	     
	     Q	  Is he influenced by that?  I mean, how does he feel 
about the fact that all of the specialists in that area -- those desk 
officers --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Many of the specialists in that area -- I 
think that that is clearly part of the process.  It's something -- 
their views will clearly be considered.  I think Secretary 
Christopher met with the group immediately to discuss their views.  I 
think he believes that there ought to be room for opinions and that 
those opinions ought to be considered, particularly from people who 
work closely on the issues.
	     
	     Q	  What do you mean, there are options on the table 
that weren't there before?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think the President said last week that 
there were options, such as lifting the arms embargo to the Bosnian 
Muslims, that had been previously off the table that are now being 
considered.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, in terms of those options, Madeleine 
Albright is saying that potentially there could be unilateral action 
by the U.S. if the Europeans did not go along.  Is that on the table?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, I can't discuss anything that would -- 
any conversations that would have happened between Ambassador 
Albright and the President.  But I think the President has said he 
would certainly -- is working with our European allies.  He's had a 
number of conversations with European leaders and is trying to build 
some consensus there.  
	     
	     Q	  Will he reach a decision -- will he have anything 
specific to say today?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No.  I mean, in term of there will be no new 
announcement of policy today.
	     
	     Q	  Does your statement mean he has ruled out 
unilateral action?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He's continuing to consult with our allies 
at this point.  He has said -- I think he's been fairly clear about 
it, that the he believes that the U.S. needs to act in concert with 
its allies on this.
	     
	     Q	  On that point, does he believe that the U.S., 
though, does have built-in authority from the United Nations already 
to take unilateral action?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Well, I think the U.N. Resolution 770 makes 
it clear that you can act unilaterally in support of any humanitarian 
relief effort.  I think the broader point is that anything we do, any 
options that we decide to pursue we will make sure that it is 
consistent with U.N. authority, and if it's not, we'll work with our 
allies to make sure that we get it.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, then how does the White House someone as 
distinguished as Elie Wiesel, who says that not enough is being done 
to stop the atrocities going on in Bosnia?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think that that's why we're considering 
additional options.  I think that Mr. Wiesel's comments yesterday 
were quite compelling.  The situation in Bosnia is tragic.  The 
President is very concerned about it.  He has -- I think President 
Clinton has worked very hard  to take further actions to continue to 
isolate Serbia in the world community.  Clearly, we're considering 
other options because the President is concerned that perhaps it's 
not enough.
	     
	     Q	  In terms of what you were just talking about, it 
sounds like Resolution 770 justifies unilateral action by the U.S. to 
protect humanitarian --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't think it -- I wouldn't use the word 
justify.  It permits unilateral action by any country in protecting 
the delivery of humanitarian relief.  But I think that's just an 
explanation of the resolution.  I think any action that we take will 
be consistent with U.N. resolutions or we'll work with our allies to 
make sure that it is permissible or we'll get further action.
	     
	     Q	  The President and other officials have ruled out 
unilateral U.S. action in Bosnia in the past.  You're declining to do 
that this morning.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, I said the President has said repeatedly 
that he wants to act in concert with our allies on this.
	     
	     Q	  That doesn't mean that he won't act alone, which 
has been said before explicitly.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't mean to imply a change in policy.  
The President has said all along that he wants to act in concert with 
our allies on this.
	     
	     Q	  One other little question.  Did he know about this 
letter from the foreign service officers before it hit the papers?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so.  Secretary Christopher 
-- they may have had a private conversation about it.  The President 
has not seen it.
	     
	     Q	  They met on Monday, right?  Christopher met --
surely, he must have brought that up --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Again, they may have talked privately about 
it, but --
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, what you're saying is that the Albright 
recommendation has been rejected, is that correct?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, I didn't say that at all.  I said I 
won't -- I said I wouldn't comment on any conversations or 
communications.
	     
	     Q	  She's advocating unilateral action and you're 
saying, in effect, that we will not take unilateral action.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I am not confirming anything that Madeleine 
Albright may or may not have recommended.
	     
	     Q	  Given the sometimes delicate, complicated and 
frustrating nature of negotiations with the allies on this issue, 
does the President find this kind of letter from 12 foreign service 
officers of the State Department helpful to that process, hurtful to 
that?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think that their views are obviously being 
considered.  The Secretary received that memo on Saturday and two 
days later he met with them in order to have a more thorough airing 
of their views, of the basis for their views, to discuss in greater 
detail the options that they had presented in the letter.
	     
	     Q	  Doesn't it put some kind of pressure on --
additional pressure on him now from within his own administration to 
act regardless of what the allies may or may not do?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think clearly there's a broad policy 
review underway now.  And the President and his advisors are 
considering a number of options, including some of those outlined in 
the letter from the folks over at the State Department.  Now, no 
decisions have been made on that yet, but I think that there is a 
through review underway, and that their opinions are being very 
seriously considered.
	     
	     Q	  If I can just follow up, I guess what I'm looking 
for is what was his reaction to this letter?  Did he say, good, this 
bolsters my position?  Or did he say, damn, this is just what I don't 
need right now?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think he said this helps contribute 
substantively to the debate.  It's important that all views be 
considered and aired thoroughly, that before he makes a decision he 
wants to have the best possible advice and information possible, and 
this, I think in many ways, furthers that goal.
	     
	     Q	  So internal advice to a Cabinet official or the 
President -- it's all open now, and you wouldn't take any umbrage or 
say that they were out of line?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think that the fact that Secretary 
Christopher met with them to discuss their views and make sure they 
had an opportunity to have a more complete conversation about it is 
conclusive evidence that their views are welcome.
	     
	     Q	  Does the policy review include what Madeleine 
Albright has suggested, and what Joe Biden and others have suggested, 
which is that the previous U.N. resolutions authorize unilateral 
action -- military action -- for the delivery of humanitarian --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table.
	     
	     Q	  The unilateral option is on the table?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think all options are on the table.
	     
	     Q	  We've had two different --
	     
	     Q	  Isn't that a change, Dee Dee?
	     
	     Q	  That would be a change of policy.
	     
	     Q	  Particularly if it includes ground troops, which 
has been specifically ruled out.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think the President has been -- well, no.  
I don't -- that is not --
	     
	     Q	  Are you talking about all options?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  All options -- I think the President has 
been fairly clear about that.  So let me just review again what he 
has said.  He has said that -- the President has said all options are 
on the table, with the exception of the introduction of ground 
troops, which he has never suggested.  He has ruled that out from the 
beginning.
	     
	     Q	  Hasn't he ruled out unilateral action of any sort?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He has said that he doesn't believe the U.S. 
can solve the problems in the former Yugoslavia by itself.  I think 
that there are a number of very complicated options on the table 
right now.  I don't think that -- again, I don't want to comment on 
specific options that are being considered other than in the broad 
categories that we've already said -- things like lifting the arms 
embargo against the Bosnian Muslims, things that I think we've talked 
about in broad terms.  This is a very complicated situation.  The 
options being presented and considered are very complicated.
	     
	     Q	  Air strikes on the table?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Again, I think that's been fairly clearly 
pointed out that that's something that's being discussed.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, are ground troops on the -- 
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, ground troops are not being considered.
	     
	     Q	  You said there was not going to be -- you said you 
were not announcing a change of policy.  Then you said everything is 
on the table.  We're confused.  Are unilateral actions on the table?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  All I can tell you is what the President has 
said -- that he doesn't believe -- that he wants to act in concert 
with the allies on this.
	     
	     Q	  Wants to, but he's willing to -- I mean, if they 
don't go along --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He's continuing to consult with our allies 
on this.  He's continuing to have discussions.  He's continuing to 
press them for further action.  And I think that's clear.  The 
conversation is ongoing.  We're going to continue to work with them 
to find the best possible solution and next step on this.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, the allies have taken the position that to 
conduct any kind of air strikes in Bosnia would have the opposite 
effect of ensuring the delivery of humanitarian aid; that they feel 
that their troops on the ground monitoring the delivery of that aid 
would become vulnerable and the Bosnians --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I'm not sure that's the consistent -- I 
mean, I'm not sure who you're referring to.
	     
	     Q	  The British and the French.
	     
	     Q	  Yes, the British and French.  They've taken the 
position that the delivery of humanitarian aid would be jeopardized 
by any kind of air strikes against the Bosnian military.  Does the 
U.S. believe differently from that?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The President has had conversations with 
both Mitterrand and Major, as you know.  I think that there is a 
thorough review of policy going on in those countries as well.  And I 
don't want to comment on the nature of the President's discussions 
other than to say that he's continuing to consult with our allies as 
we move forward and he's continuing to press them for further action.  
And I think that process is ongoing.
	     
	     Q	     the other day voted against any military 
intervention yesterday.  Does the President regard that as the end of 
the line or does he does still hold out some possibility of 
unilateral action?  The allies have been very, very plain that they 
do not want to do anything.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The consultations are ongoing.  That's all I 
can tell you at this point.
	     
	     Q	  Are you saying that there won't be any announcement 
on Bosnia today in the press conference?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, that is not the intention of the press 
conference.
	     
	     Q	  What is the intention?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's an opportunity to take questions.  He 
may have a brief -- I'm sure he'll have a brief opening statement, 
but it is not an opportunity to outline a new policy on Bosnia.  That 
will not happen.
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us what the subject of the opening 
statement is?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's sort of a general statement of where we 
are.
	     
	     Q	  After the first hundred days, you mean?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's not a long statement.  I mean, this is 
just generally.  Don't look for any major policy pronouncements.
	     
	     Q	  Do you know what the opening statement is?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  But it's -- perhaps later today I'll be able 
to tell you with more certainty -- I think that's still under review.  
But the overriding purpose of this -- it's not a mystery; it's not 
meant to be.  It's just to take questions.
	     
	     Q	  It would be helpful to know whether -- what the 
opening statement is on.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Since the major purpose here is just to take 
questions, it's not completely resolved yet.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, one policy that was expected last week and 
that the White House, you and George seemed to indicate we might get, 
would be an AIDS czar.  Will he announce that today?  And what's the 
delay on that?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't think we meant to imply -- I think 
we said it would happen soon.  I don't think we meant to imply with 
any certainty that it would be this week.  It is coming soon.  I 
don't anticipate that happening today.
	     
	     Q	  What's the delay?  Isn't this the perfect time to 
announce an AIDS czar?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know that it's a delay.  I think the 
process is ongoing to find the best possible person and to go through 
the necessary background checks, and to make sure that we've crossed 
the t's and dotted the i's before we make an announcement.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, what are Zoe Baird's qualifications for 
the Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?  And why wasn't her 
appointment announced here?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  The qualifications -- I don't know if 
there's a specific list; I'll have to check and see.  I think there 
are a number of people there on the board with different backgrounds.  
Many of them have long histories in intelligence or other government 
service.  I think there's a broad variety of views across political 
spectrum and across backgrounds that are represented there.  We never 
made a formal announcement other than the Chairman of the Board, 
which is Admiral William Crowe.
	     
	     Q	  Why would he appoint her, though, if the American 
people and many in the Senate rejected her for another government 
job?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe that the American people 
ever had -- voted on her.  And I certainly -- she was never rejected 
in the Senate.  She never went up there for a hearing.  But the 
President believes she's a very competent person.  He's said that -- 
Zoe Baird -- do you understand what the question is?  Zoe Baird is on 
the President's Foreign Intelligence --
	     
	     Q	  You said she never went up there for a hearing?
	     
	     Q	  Her nomination was withdrawn after public outrage 
over violating federal laws?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Right, she never -- she was never -- but you 
said she was rejected by the Senate.  I was just simply trying to 
point out that she was never voted on by the Senate.
	     
	     Q	  So you don't think that is any problem?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't think there's any problem.
	     
	     Q	  She has been appointed to this board, is that a 
fact?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Yes.
	     
	     Q	  Does she need confirmation for this?  Does she need 
confirmation to be a member of the --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No.  It's a presidential appointment.
	     
	     Q	  Usually, announcements are made here at the White 
House.  Was there a decision not to announce her publicly?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We didn't make an announcement.  People who 
asked were told who  the members of the board were.  We didn't make 
an official announcement.  If anybody's interested in that we can 
certainly put out the list of names.
	     
	     Q	  I'd like to know.
	     
	     Q	  Don't such board members -- don't you normally as a  
matter of -- routinely put out releases on all these boards and 
presidential appointment regardless of their dimension?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Not always.  But, again, I'm happy to put 
this out.
	     
	     Q	  Isn't that the standard practice?
	     
	     Q	  That was past practice.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Again, I'm happy to put it out.  We'll put 
out a list of the members of the board today.
	     
	     Q	  Dee Dee, I don't want to try to fail to let you get 
out of this swamp but -- (laughter) -- all I really want to know is 
hasn't it been the practice in this administration for such 
announcements to be made routinely?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I think generally but not always.  And we're 
happy to put that out today.
	     
	     Q	  What is the board, what is her title, what is the 
size of the board?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  There is roughly a dozen members on the 
board.  It is a civilian board, although their are some, obviously, 
retired military personnel on the board that provide input into 
intelligence policy for the President.  Again, the chairman of that 
board is Admiral William Crowe.
	     
	     Q	  And did he recommend Baird?
	     
	     Q	  What's the name of the board?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's the President's Foreign Intelligence 
Advisory Board, PFIAB.
	     
	     Q	  What's her qualification -- that she had employed 
an illegal alien?  Is that -- (laughter) -- 
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Do you want an answer to the question or you 
just want to make a joke?
	     
	     Q	  Let me phrase it another way.  Why shouldn't this 
appointment be viewed as a pay-back for the difficulty she had a 
couple of months ago?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Because it's not.  
	     
	     Q	  What's her experience in foreign intelligence?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  She's an experienced attorney, someone who 
the President believes is very competent and qualified.  And I think 
part of the mission of this board is to provide civilian input.  Not 
everybody on the board is supposed to be an intelligence expert; that 
is not the board's mission.  It is to provide civilian input for the 
President as he makes decisions regarding intelligence matters.  He 
believes she's very qualified, very competent person, enormously 
talented and has said that throughout.
	     
	     Q	  Is this just a figment of my overactive 
imagination, or was there discussion early on about abolishing the 
President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't think so.  On December 24th, when he 
announced all of his foreign policy advisors he announced that he 
would -- had appointed Admiral Crowe as the head of the board.  So I 
don't believe there's ever been any --
	     
	     Q	  Earlier than that, during the transition.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No, I don't believe so.  It was announced, 
again, on December 24th.  Admiral Crowe couldn't be there, but it was 
announced. 
	     
	     Q	  Are members paid?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't believe so, but I'll double-check.
	     
	     Q	  On another subject, on Waco, how do you explain the 
discrepancy between the federal reports of the autopsies of the 
bodies that are coming out of Waco and the state?  I guess it's the 
Texas Ranger reports.  
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Most of the information is coming -- the 
federal information is coming from the site.  Clearly, there's been 
some discrepancies and the Justice Department is looking into it.  
Officials in the Justice Department were told, I believe the day 
before yesterday, that there were several bodies found with bullet 
holes.  I think there's some discrepancy about that, and the Justice 
Department is looking into it.
	     
	     Q	  Is the President going to get involved in trying to 
sort out what seems to be becoming a jurisdictional morass down 
there, with some people withdrawing, others saying they're in charge, 
but others -- Justice, FBI, Texas Rangers -- all grabbing a piece of 
this?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know that he's going to try to 
mediate the dispute.  I mean, I'll let you know if there's anything 
he intends to do about it.  But as you know, there are several levels 
of investigation ongoing, and we're hopeful that they can work 
together. 
	     
	     Q	  Is there any one agency or official down there in 
charge of everything?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't know.  I'll have to get back to you 
on that.
	     
	     Q	  What is the subject matter of Sunday's speech?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's going to be fairly general.  I don't 
think it's going to be any specific announcements.  I think it's 
going to be sort of a --
	     
	     Q	  Does he have a topic that he's going to talk about?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We're still working on it.  But I wouldn't 
look for any announcements of, like, the drug czar or something like 
that.
	     
	     Q	  Is it sort of a 100 days speech, sort of ""my 
excellent adventure for 100 days""?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Not exactly, but I think he'll take a little 
bit broader look about what's happened in the last --
	     
	     Q	  Foreign, domestic?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  A little bit of both, but I think a lot of 
domestic.
	     
	     Q	  And overview. 
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Yes, more of an overview than a specific 
policy announcement.  
	     	  
	     Q	  Has there been an agreement yet on a forum by which 
the President will address the gay rights march on Sunday?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It will be a letter read to the crowd by 
Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi.
	     
	     Q	  Is that available?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Not yet, but it will be.  Sure.
	     
	     Q	  Are you going to put it out here or --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  We'll probably put it out here on Sunday.
	     
	     Q	  Travel next week?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Unclear.
	     
	     Q	  What was the question?
	     
	     Q	  Likely?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't --
	     
	     Q	  Likely?  Possible?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Possible.
	     
	     Q	  What's possible?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Travel.
	     
	     Q	  George mentioned yesterday campaign finance reform 
and national service legislative proposals next week.  Do you have 
days yet for them?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Not yet.
	     
	     Q	  Can you tell us which order?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Campaign finance reform first; national 
service later in the week.
	     
	     Q	  Is there any coverage tomorrow in Williamsburg?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No.
	     
	     Q	  And any report in the aftermath of the day?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Any readout from the day?
	     
	     Q	  Readout.
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  It's possible.  Jeff Eller will be down 
there.  I think he can go through what the President did during the 
day.  We don't expect any photo op or anything, other than departure 
here in the morning.
	     
	     Q	   Dee Dee, the President has not made a regular 
practice, as some of his predecessors have, of going to Camp David.  
In fact, he's been there -- what -- once or twice?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  Twice.
	     
	     Q	  Why this weekend?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He went two weekends ago, as you know, on 
the way home from his father-in-law's funeral.  I think that they 
found it to be a good experience and a nice way for them to spend 
some time together as a family.  And this is just an opportunity to 
do the same.
	     
	     Q	  There's no march there.
	     
	     Q	  It has nothing to do with the march here?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  No.
	     
	     Q	  Since he's going to be in town Sunday morning now 
instead of in Jamestown, have you thought about him making a quick 
pass-by, fly-over -- (laughter) --
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  He'll fly straight to Boston.
	     
	     Q	  Flying straight did you say?  (Laughter.)
	     
	     Q	  George took a question yesterday on Waco.  The 
President had said on Tuesday in the Rose Garden that there was a 
minor disagreement on tactics between the military advisors and the 
FBI.  And the question was whether you knew exactly what that was and 
whether it related to the use of the particular kind of tear gas.  Do 
you have an answer on that?
	     
	     MS. MYERS:  I don't.  I'll check.
	     
	     THE PRESS:  Thank you.

                                 END10:59 A.M. EDT

Sixteen days I had put off test driving the Honda ST1100.  Finally,
the 17th was a Saturday without much rain.  In fact it cleared up, 
became warm and sunny, and the wind died.  About three weeks ago, I
took a long cool ride on the Hawk down to Cycles! 128 for a test ride.
They had sold, and delivered, the demo ST1100 about fifteen hours
before I arrived.  And the demo VFR was bike-locked in the showroom --
surrounded by 150 other bikes, and not likely to move soon.

Today was different.  There were even more bikes.  50 used dirt bikes,
50 used street bikes, 35 cars, and a big tent full of Outlandishly Fat
Touring Bikes With Trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot.
Some sort of fat bike convention.  Shelly and Dave were running one
MSF course each, at the same time.  One in the classroom and one on
the back lot.  Plus, there was the usuall free cookout food that
Cycles! gives away every weekend in the summer.  Hmmm, it seemed like
a big moto party.

After about ten minutes of looking for Rob C, cheif of sales slime,
and another 5 minutes reading and signing a long disclosure/libility/
pray-to-god form I helped JT push the ST out into the mess in the
parking lot.  We went over the the controls, I put the tank bag from 
the Hawk into the right saddlebag, and my wife put everything else
into the left saddlebag.  ( Thats nice.... )  Having helped push the 
ST out to the lot, I thought it best to have JT move it to the edge of
the road, away from the 100+ bikes and 100+ people.  He rode it like a
bicycle!  'It cant be that heavy' I thought.

Well I was wrong.  As I sat on the ST, both feet down, all I could 
think was ""big"".  Then I put one foot up.  ""Heavy"" came to mind very
quickly.  With Cindy on the back -- was she on the back?  Hard to 
tell with seat three times as large as a Hawk seat -- the bike seemed
nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road.

By 3000 rpm in second gear, all the weight seemed to dissappear.  Even
on bike with 4.1 miles on the odometer, slippery new tires, and pads that 
did not yet bite the disks, things seems smooth and sure.  Cycles! is
on a section of 128 that few folks ever ride.  About 30 miles north
of the computer concentration, about five miles north of where I95
splits away, 128 is a lighly travelled, two lane limited access
highway.  It goes through heavily forested sections of Hamilton, 
Manchester-by-the-Sea and Newbury on its way to Gloucester.
On its way there, it meets 133, a road that winds from the sea about
30 miles inland to Andover.  On its way it goes through many
thoroughly New England spots.  Perfect, if slow, sport touring sections.

Cindy has no difficulty with speed.  3rd gear, 4th gear, purring along
in top gear.  This thing has less low rpm grunt that my Hawk.  Lane 
changes were a new experience.  A big heft is required to move this 
thing.  Responds well though.   No wallowing or complaint.  Behind the
fairing it was fairly quiet, but the helmet buffeting was
non-trivial.  Top gear car passing at 85mph was nearly effortless.
Smooth, smooth, smooth.   Not sure what the v4 sound reminds me of,
but it is pleasant.  If only the bars were not transmitting an endless
buzz.

The jump on to 133 caused me to be less than impressed with the
brakes.  Its a down hill, reversing camber, twice-reversing radius,
decreasing radius turn.  A real squeeze is needed on the front binder.  
The section of 133 we were on was tight, but too urban.  The ST works ok
in this section, but it shows its weight.  We went by the clam shack
oft featured in ""Spencer for Hire"" -- a place where you could really 
find ""Spencer"", his house was about 15 miles down 133.  After putting
through traffic for a while, we turned and went back to 128.

About half way through the onramp, I yanked Cindy's wrist, our singal
for ""hold on tight"".  Head check left,  time to find redline.  Second
gear gives a good shove.  Third too.  Fourth sees DoD speed with a 
short shift into top.  On the way to 133 we saw no cops and very light
traffic.  Did not cross into DoD zone because the bike was too new.
Well, now it had 25 miles on it, so it was ok.  Tried some high effort
lane changes, some wide sweeping turns.  Time to wick it up?  I went 
until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat.  And stayed
there.  When I was comfortable with the wind and the steering, 
I looked down to find an indicated 135mph.  Not bad for 2-up touring.

Beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit.  At the ""get
off in a mile"" sign, I rolled off the throttle and coasted.  I wanted
to re-adjust to the coming slowness.  It was a good idea:  there were
several manhole-sized patches of sand on the exit ramp.  Back to the 
slow and heavy behavior.  Cycles! is about a mile from 128.  I could 
see even more cars stacked up outside right when I got off.  I managed
to thread the ST through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad
out front.  Heavy.  It took way too much effort for Cindy and I to put
the thing on the center stand.  I am sure that if I used the side
stand the ST would have been on its side within a minute.


My demo opinion?  Heavy.  Put it on a diet.  Smooth, comfortable,
hardly notices the DoD speed.   I'd buy on for about $3000 less than 
list, just like it is.  Too much $ for the bike as it is.

Not alone at all. My old 83 Accord (now in the hands of a sibling) has a much
better engagement of the clutch. Even the old 84 Civic we keep as a beater 
feels better in this aspect. Note that these are cars with 250,000 kms and
140,000 kms respectively. My 90 Prelude blows both of them away in every 
respect except smooth clutch engagement. Of course the Kawasaki is the best
of the bunch but I need more than 2 wheels most of the time.

The Prelude has had a dud clutch from day 1, and after three years and 67,000
kms is no better. Best of luck and feel free to add this to your collection.

If anyone is interested in the history of AMORC, I do think Spencer
Lewis published books about the beginning and his mission. The 
Alexandria bookstore (that's the name of the book store operated 
by AMORC) should have a selection that should provide the interested
reader more insight).

Ahhhhh, but that *is* the point.   Honor should demand that each of them
recognize that there is error/fault/misunderstanding aplenty in the
situation, and to apologize to each other.

But, since there is no honor *between* the two of them, they hold to
their own thickheaded paths, refusing to recognize each other as human,
and dragging the family feud out into the future.

Honor is both an individual trait, and a contract *between* two or more
folk.

I keep hearing this, but every assertion of this form has come from
government sources except two.  As far as I am concerned, I am not
ready to stipulate that Koresh EVER promised to come out except for
his first promise and his last promise.

The first promise was conditional on his audio tape being given 
NATIONAL exposure.  Well, it never was -- it was broadcast locally,
in a chopped-up fashion, and that's all.  And even then, they cleverly 
cut it off when it got to the part where he demanded ""national exposure,""
but not so cleverly that we didn't hear it.

The last promise was conditional on the finishing of his manuscript.
We'll never know if he would have kept that one.

Strangely enough, the previous day they said they were prepared to

Quite possible.  But arguments of intent do not mark the dividing 
line between guilt and innocence -- only the line between murder and 
negligent manslaughter.

It's too tempting for one or more of the survivors to ""go state's
evidence,"" parrot the FBI story, hang the whole ""suicide"" on Koresh, 
claim they only stayed at gunpoint, etc.  If any of them do this
in the next few weeks, it doesn't prove much; but if none of them
do, it would be a strong indication to me that the FBI story is
dead wrong.

The probability is that the Oilers are not going anywhere.

Pocklington has chosen this moment to make his ""last"" stand is
because he is at the moment of maximum advantage...the provincial
government is months away from a provincial election...it is
the moment when he has maximum power to convince Northlands
to give him a better arena deal or a better purchase price...
and it is before the NHL's new collective agreement with
the players which might involve some enhanced revenue-sharing.

Pocklington is many things...stupid is not one of them.

He can dictate terms...because other cities will pay his
price if Edmonton doesn't.

Edmonton has already fucked up its international airport, and
surrendered supremacy to Calgary, and over the next few years
Edmonton is going to take a hard hit from government cutbacks.
It will screw itself beyond recogniton if it manages to find
a way to lose its hockey team too...because Northlands wants
to continue to use the Oilers to subsidize horse racing.

However, in this case, about the long-term financial
viability of the Oilers, the fact is that Pocklington is basically 
right, regardless of who owns the team, and it is right to provoke
the crisis now, before the team accumulates millions of dollars
in losses, or becomes habitually uncompetitive because of lack
of money.

Sather has done his job...the Oilers are poised to be competitive
again very soon (Al Strachan, one of the most knowledgeble hockey
writers in Canada in a post-mortem of the Oilers season in
the Globe and Mail recently agrees with me.)

        This one is easy, they 'tape' the conversation, call the FBI or
Secret Service.  You see ""activities against the Satan Clinton"" could be
construed as a threat against the President of the United States.  I am
sure they(NSA,FBI,SS,...,...) have enough judges in their collective
pockets to have a warrent before the call is over.....

This is a general question for US readers:

How extensive is the playoff coverage down there?  In Canada, it is almost
impossible not to watch a series on TV (ie the only two series I have not had
an opportunity to watch this year are Wash-NYI and Chi-Stl, the latter because
I'm in the wrong time zone!).  We (in Canada) are basically swamped with 
coverage, and I wonder how many series/games are televised nationally or even
locally in the US and how much precedence they take over, say, local news if
the games go into double-OT.

Email me so as not to waste bandwidth, please.  My news feed is kind of slow
anyways.

Which distance? The distance between one point (t = ti) on the first curve
and a point on the other curve with same parameter (u = ti)?

This may come as a surprise to you but there are a few americans who do not

The Defamation League has done a first class job of damage control..in what

Worse?  Maybe not, but it is definately a violation of the

should be changed to?  But I'm not personally as concerned

I have placed a new release of my aXe editor in aXe-5.0.tar.Z on
export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12) and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1).

The significant change this time, and the justification for the hike
in the major version number, is:

  o undo has been implemented.

    By default only the last change can be undone, but a resource is
    provided to allow the user to specify how many, including unlimited,
    levels of undo information should be kept. Also, undo of undo is
    supported.

There is no truth in the rumour that the next version will be EmaXe 19 :-)

                          -=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

For those who have not encountered aXe before here is a summary of
what it is all about:

aXe is a simple to use text editor for X that represents a significant
improvement over xedit. Also built around the Athena Text Widget it
features, amongst other things,

   o multiple windows
   o multiple buffers
   o default menu interface
   o optional button interface, with choice and layout of buttons 
     under user control
   o minibuffer for expert use and access to external filters
   o provision for defining a keyboard macro
   o geometry specification and resizing in terms of characters
   o file selection via a browser
   o knowledge of line numbers
   o parenthesis matching
   o regular expression searching
   o restricted or unlimited undo
   o ability to change font
   o easy entry of control codes
   o xterm-like keymap feature
   o easy runtime setting of selected preferences (resources)
   o both brief and comprehensive on-line help
   o server mode with cooperating client programs
   o optional extension language using Tcl
   o optional Xaw3d widget set compatability
   o collection of reusable widgets that embody the functionality of aXe

I have personally built and run core aXe, i.e. without the Tcl and
Xaw3d options, on the following systems:

   Sun SPARC        SunOS 4.1.x     MIT X11R5
   Sun SPARC        SunOS 5.1       MIT X11R5
   Encore Multimax  UMAX 4.3        MIT X11R5
   DEC 5000/120     ULTRIX 4.2      MIT X11R5
   HP 9000/710      HP-UX 8.07      MIT X11R5
   MAC IIci         AU/X 3.0        MIT X11R5
   
but not all have been subject to the same level of testing. I have
only tested the Tcl and Xaw3d options on the first.

A number of '#ifdef SYSV'-isms that have been fed back to me have been
incorporated into the code and a possible scandir replacement is
provided for those systems that do not have one.

Although aXe will probably build under R4 run-time problems have been
encountered in the past. I have not bothered to try this version under
R4, and have not put any effort into solving previously known
problems.  Therefore, if you are at R4 you very much take pot luck. If
it doesn't work the only alternative is to try the last release,
2.1.1, of version 2 which should still be around. It doesn't have as
many features and uses the Widget Creation Library (Wcl). Not only
that, it requires an old version of Wcl, 1.06 or 1.05. Version 3 of
aXe was nearing completion when version 2 of Wcl came out so aXe 2
never got converted to make use of it.

aXe is available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (18.24.0.12)
and arjuna.ncl.ac.uk (128.240.150.1) initially, and probably in due
course from several other ftp sites.  Check your nearest using
xarchie.

If you can't ftp, try sending email to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com with the
word ""help"" alone in your message body.  You will receive instructions
on how to ftp via email.

   This is hilarious.  Here we have a self-described libertarian 
   getting all sentimental over a religious and national entity
   not exactly known for respecting individualism.   In somewhat
   more detail it should be noted that the whole concept of a 
   religion, and especially a patriarchial one like Judaism 
   (or Islam, or Christianity) is obediance to rules and authority.
   Leviticus, Deuteronomy, etc are FULL of ""thou shalt""s and ""thou
   shalt not""s.   And of course Israel's concept of human rights, while
   no doubt better than places like Syria's or Iraqs, is hardly the 
   stuff to warm the cockles of a libertarian's heart.

I strongly disagree that absolute truth would not require interpretation.
That's because truth may be absolute, but it may not be obvious.  Like
so many things, the truth is always subject to misinterpretation.

I strongly suspect that we are reaching an impasse here, which is why I
deign from commenting much further.

Now hold it.  I never said that Christians cannot be arrogant.  Indeed, as
many other Christians on SRC have stressed before, this is a trap that
Christians must always be wary about.  However, this does not mean that if
you believe in the absolutes established by the Bible, you are necessarily
being arrogant.  A Christian can believe that the Word of God is absolute,
but he or she should not expect this to be immediately evident to everyone.
 
>So, I think that your position is:

>Did I get that right?

Not quite.  You say that according to my stance, we cannot *reliably*
determine what is true.  That is not what I said.  I say that as fallible
human beings, we cannot discern the truth with 100% certainty.  The 
distinction is subtle yet important.

When a scientist performs an experiment, he can claim that his results
are reliable, without claiming that absolutely no mistake whatsoever could
have been made.  In other words, he can admit that he could be mistaken,
without sacrificing his convictions.

Nobody can establish what absolute truth is with 100% certainty.
Throughout the centuries, philosophers have argued about what we can know
with complete certainty and what we cannot.  Descartes made a step in the
right direction when he uttered, ""Cogito, ergo sum,"" yet we have not advanced
much beyond that.

Do you believe that other people aside from you exist?  Do you believe that
the computer terminal you are using exists?  If so, can you be absolutely
certain about that?  Are you sure it is not some grand illusion?  Of course,
you have no such assurance.  This does not mean, however, that for all
practical purposes, you can be certain that they exist.  So it is with
Christianity.  The most mature Christians I know have deep convictions about
absolute morality, yet they acknowledge that there is a non-zero probability 
that they are wrong.  This does not, however, mean that they should (or do) 
abandon these absolutes.

>What's the point of spending all this time claiming and defending 
>absolute truth, when we can never know what those truths are, and we

As I said, we can never be absolutely certain that we are correct.  This does
not mean that we cannot be certain enough, in light of the evidence, to 
render all doubts unreasonable.

	But, you are not differentiating between the different types of

""values"". I would like to attribute such an attempt at white washing the

There is no contradiction here. It is essential in the sense that your

Although the Hebrew expression LE'UM is used, the ID card specifically states on
the 2nd page: EZRACHUT YISREALIT: Israeli citizen. This is true for all
Israeli citizens no matter what their ethnicity. In the United States most
official forms have RACE (Caucasian, Black, AmerIndian, etc.).

Apart from Mordechai Vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors, there was one
other espionage case (the nutty professor at the Nes Ziona Biological
Institute who was a K.G.B. mole) who was tried ""in camera"". I wouldn't exactly
call it a state secret. The trial was simply tried behind closed doors. I hate
to disappoint you but the United States has tried a number of espionage cases
in camera.

Not Jews. Israeli citizens. Jordanian law is in effect in the West Bank but the
KNESSET passed a law that Israeli law would be binding on Israeli citizens
residing in the West Bank. These citizens could be Jews, Israeli Muslims, Druze,
or Israeli Christians. It has NOTHING to do with religion.

Anyone who was registered (Jew, Muslim, Christian) could return. You might be
confusing this with the census taken in June 1967 on the West Bank after the
Six Day War. In *this* instance, if the Arab was not physically present he
couldn't reside on the West Bank (e.g. if he had been visting Jordan).

No. Not even if you drowned him in bourbon, scotch or brandy :-)

Not true. Although a minority, there *are* some Israeli Arabs living on
kibbutzim. On the other hand, at my age (42) I wouldn't be admitted to a
kibbutz nor could the family join me. Not that I would be so thrilled to do so
in the first place. The kibbbutz movement places candidates under rigorous
membership criteria. Many Israeli Jews are not admitted.

The religious status quo in Israel has marriage and divorce  handled by the
religious courts. The RABBANUT handles marriage and divorce for Jews, the
Muslim SHAARIA  courts are for Muslims, the Christian denominations have their
religious courts, and the Druze have their own courts. The entire religious
establishment (Jewish, Muslim, Druze, Christian) wants to keep it that way.

I believe it's adjacent to a former Muslim cemetary. From what I heard (and I'd
like to get feedback from Muslins  on the net) sanctity of cemetaries is not
held that sancrosanct as it is held by Jews. The current Israeli Ministry of
Trade and Industry on Agron Road in Jerusalem is housed in a former hotel that
was built by Arabs in the 1920's on the site of an Arab cemetary.

I currently have some grayscale image files that are not in any

like to display these images on a PC.  The conversion to a GIF format
would be helpful.  This conversion can take place either on a PC
or on a UNIX system and I could then download it to the PC.
Can anyone suggest where I can find software to do this?  Alternatively, I
may have to write my own conversion program.  In this case, could someone
tell me where I can find the GIF format specification?

Um, what?  Eddie Murray was a superb first baseman for a *long* time.

Winfield as produced consistently for almsot 20 years, and excellently
on several occasions.  

Dave Kingman's *best* year was like Darryl Strawberry's *typical*
year with the Mets.  

Darrell Evans, too, did a whole lot more than just hit homers, which 
*is* all that Kong did.

Whom are you talking about?  Yes, Eddie Murray is marginal, but that's
because he's 38 years old.  He wasn't marginal for a *long* time.

Not.  

Smith has hung around for a long time AND fielded the position better 
than anyone else ever has.

Yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago, in case you hadn't 
noticed.

One of his two MVP awards was as a centerfielder.

>     Let's be a little more selective, huh? Stop handing out these honors

Like whom?  There are many players in the Hall who aren't anywhere near
as goos as the guys you're running down.

>something

That's already the case, by some standards.  But the *bad* players in the 
Hall are all from the 20's and 30's.  Recent picks have generally been
excellent.

>certain individuals believe that Steve Garvey or Jack Morris are potential
>candidates, the absurdity is apparent. Gee, can these guys even compare to
>the more likely future Hall of Famers like Kirby Puckett or Nolan Ryan?

No, but who cares?  Was Stan Musial anywhere near as good as Babe Ruth?
Not really.  But he obviously belongs there.

The Hall has generally had about the top 1% of major leaguers.  As 
more players come through the game, more will be in that top 1%.  

And, yes, it's pretty easy to argue that Smith,. Yount, Evans, Winfield,
etc. are in the top 1%.  Dave Kingman on the other hand, was a liability
throughout most of his career.

Of course, Garvey *hasn't* gotten a lot of HOF press, so I don't know
what you mean.  

As for Ryan, is his W-L better than Morris'?  That's what a lot of voters
tend to look at.  And Morris *was* awfully good for a decade, and doesn't
lead MLB history in walks allowed, either.

The above does not tell the proper story of SCSI:
SCSI-I: 8-bit asynchronous {~1.5MB/s ave}, synchronous {5MB/s max} transfer 
base.
SCSI-1{faster} this requires a SCSI-2 controller chip and provides
 SCSI-2 {8-bit to 16-bit} speeds with SCSI-1 controlers.
SCSI-2: 4-6MB/s with 10MB/s burst{8-bit}, 8-12MB/s with 20MB/s burst {16-bit}, 
and 15-20MB/s with 40MB/s burst{32-bit/wide and fast}.  16-bit SCSI can be
wide or fast, it depends on how the port is designed{The Quadras will support
fast SCSI but not wide when the OS SCSI manager is rewritten since the
Quardas use a SCSI-1 {non-wide} port}.

The article in PC Mag 4/27/93:29 was talking about SCSI-1 {SCSI-2 uses
TEN (10) devices in it native mode, outside its native mode it behaves a
lot like SCSI-1 (7 devices, slower through put}

From your own figures SCSI-1 is indeed twice ESDI as the article pointed out
as for ""20% faster then IDE"" that seems to be 8-bit SCSI-1 using a SCSI-2 
contoler chip {The Mac Quadra uses a SCSI-2 controler chip for its SCSI-1
and gets 6MB/s through put for asynchronous {8-bit} SCSI-1, far in excess of a
normal SYNCHRONOUS SCSI-1 output} 120% of 8.3 is 9.96 which is near
the burst of a SCSI-1 machine with a SCSI-2 controller chip.

The PC world seems to have SCSI-1 and SCSI-2 mixed up.  Fact is SCSI-2 
controler chips allow near SCSI-2 speeds through a SCSI-1 device
{As shown in the Mac Quadra} which skews some of the data of SCSI-1 vs
IDE or ESDI test. I agree that the article COULD have stated that the ""20%
faster then IDE"" came off a SCSI-1 device with a SCSI-2 chip.  Maybe it
was there and the EDITOR killed it because the article was dealing with
SCSI-1 NOT SCSI-2 and he did not understand the effect of a SCSI-1 device
with a SCSI-2 controller chip.
SCSI-1 chips are limited to 5/MB max.  SCSI-1 devices with SCSI-2 chips
{becoming common} produce up to 10Mb/s in 8-bit mode and 20MB/s in 16-bit
mode {the fast version, SCSI-1 ports cannot use wide SCSI}.  Of cource
the prime piece of wierdness is that SCSI-1 devices HAVE SCSI-2 chips
{or more accurately the machine does}. This allows the best of BOTH
worlds: high SCSI-2 speeds and cheeper SCSI-1 costs {FULL SCSI-2 hardware
(port, electronic controller, etc) is VERY expensive.  It ALSO creates
a logistic NIGHTMARE as to how fast SCSI-1 goes.

When one knows the FACTS behind the numbers then one realizes that the
article knows what it is talking about {even if it does not tell HOW the
figures came about} while  DXB132@psuvm.psu.edu is throwing out
ranges that don't tell SQUAT {Since he IGNORES SCSI-1 devices with
SCSI-2 chips his ranges tell even LESS then intended.} }

Yep, that's pretty much it. I'm not a Jew but I understand that this is the
Jewish way of thinking. However, the Jews believe that the Covenant between
YHWH and the Patriarchs (Abraham and Moses, in this case) establishes a Moral
Code to follow for mankind. Even the Jews could not decide where the boundaries
fall, though.

As I understand it, the Sadducees believed that the Torah was all that was
required, whereas the Pharisees (the ancestors of modern Judaism) believed that
the Torah was available for interpretation to lead to an understanding of
the required Morality in all its nuances (->Talmud).

The essence of all of this is that Biblical Morality is an interface between
Man and YHWH (for a Jew or Christian) and does not necessarily indicate
anything about YHWH outside of that relationship (although one can speculate).

The trouble with all of this is that we don't really know what the ""created
in His image"" means. I've heard a number of different opinions on this and
have still not come to any conclusion. This rather upsets the Apple Cart if
one wants to base a Life Script on this shaky foundation (to mix metaphors
unashamedly!) As to living by Christ's example, we know very little about
Jesus as a person. We only have his recorded utterances in a set of narratives
by his followers, and some very small references from comtemporary historians.
Revelation aside, one can only ""know"" Christ second-hand or worse.

This is not an attempt to debunk Christianity (although it may seem that way
initially), the point I`m trying to make is that we only really have the Bible
to interpret, and that interpretation is by humanity. I guess this is where
Faith or Relevation comes in with all its inherent subjectiveness.

>
>Metaphysically, if there are multiple moral codes then there is no
>Absolute moral code, and I think this is theologically questionable.

No. There may be an absolute moral code. There are undoubtably multiple
moral codes. The multiple moral codes may be founded in the absolute moral
code. As an example, a parent may tell a child never to swear, and the child
may assume that the parent never swears simply because the parent has told
the child that it is ""wrong"". Now, the parent may swear like a trooper in
the pub or bar (where there are no children). The ""wrongness"" here is if
the child disobeys the parent. The parent may feel that it is ""inappropriate""
to swear in front of children but may be quite happy to swear in front of
animals. The analogy does not quite hold water because the child knows that
he is of the same type as the parent (and may be a parent later in life) but
you get the gist of it? Incidentally, the young child considers the directive
as absolute until he gets older (see Piaget) and learns a morality of his own.

David.

The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to
death, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two
on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the
right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and
went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to
the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he
missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,
reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.

Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that
Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially
behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate
vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with
Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan
who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious
to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as
soon as he realized he had made the catch.

That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry
went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot
of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of
costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled
food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium
officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and
just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,
Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a
tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about 
winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made
the catch.

Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech
wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that
are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any 
that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have
been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility
of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he
is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated
his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is
impossible.

Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what
the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first
nine games.

I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull
hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,
he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.

But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities
of the fan.

Well, yeah, but unlike TIFF they all do substantially more than encode
rectangular bitmaps.  And the others are hardly trouble free.  I hear that
it is quite common for CGM implementations not to interoperate.

The annoying thing about TIFF is that is that along with the 50 useful
options, there are 100 stupid options.  The most egregious example is that
rather than picking a byte order and bit order and using it consistently
in all TIFF files, byte and bit order are options and all TIFF readers on
all machines, no matter what their natural byte order, have to be prepared
to do byte swapping.  There are four slightly different FAX formats --
again, any one of them would have been adequate.  RGB images can be stored
by pixel or by component, complexity without function, etc, etc.  I also
note that the TIFF doc says that Aldus' experiments show that LZW reliably
compresses as well or better than any of the FAX formats, suggesting that
none of the FAX formats are really useful.

What's worse, a lot of the formats aren't even implemented very well,
e.g., LZW limits code words to 12 bits, while 14 or 16 bits would have
provided substantially better compression.  And the LZW method compresses
bytes rather than pixels.

But the absolute worst thing about TIFF is that any vendor can register
proprietary TIFF codes and formats without even publicly documenting them.
This means that there is NO WAY to write a TIFF reader that can reliably
read all incoming TIFF files.  Some standard.

I have this same alarm installed in my Syclone.  It works great.  The shock
sensor is very sensitive, but much more practical than the motion sensor I have
on my other car.  It doesn't trigger if the car is rocked gently by the wind,
but any kind of shock sets it off.  Even kicking the tire sets it off.  It
works great.

The shock sensor is adjustable and there are two cycles on it.  You can adjust
it to be sensitive enough that there is no way you could open the hood without
setting off the alarm.  Although, I know that you cannot pop the hood on the
Syclone without setting off my alarm now, and yet I have had zero (none!) false
alarms with this system.  The alarm tells you when you disarm it whether it has
been activated in your absence.  I have been able to trace every alarm to it's
cause and it was not a false alarm.

I guess it would be possible depending on the vehicle.  My Syclone is so tight
in the engine compartment that it would be tough to do this.  There are
supplemental power supplies you can put on with this Viper alarm, but I don't
have one.  I really think that if someone wants my car that bad, the alarm
won't keep them from it, even with a supplemental power supply.

This is primarily for convertibles.  I have a convertible and have looked at
this feature in detail.  Alpine actually makes a better radar unit if you want
to get one of these.  It has zones in it that can be shut down independently so
that if one side of your car has pedestrian traffic or something else that
would trigger an alarm, it shuts down the zone, or rather, pulls it in tighter.
I don't see the real benefit to these unless you have a convertible that you
leave the top down on.

Avoid the voice alarm that can be added to the radar package.  It talks to
people as they walk by.  I saw one installed on a Lotus Esprit.  The kids would
taunt it seeing how close they could get before it 'warned' them to get back. 
The owner finally disabled it, which defeats the purpose in my mind.
>

I am real happy with my Viper.  One other feature I really like is you can tune
it to your preferences.  You can have it arm passively or not.  You can disable
the chirp for arming/disarming.  You can have it lock/unlock the doors when the
alarm is armed/disarmed.  

I like these features.  I hate the chirp when the alarm arms/disarms, so mine
flashes the lights only.  I like the door lock feature, although I have to be
careful to take my keys with me because it doesn't know if you have left your
keys in the car when it passively arms and locks the doors.  But, if you are
meticulous about taking your keys with you, it takes care of the rest.

I looked seriously at the Alpine system too.  It is a real nice system, but
more money and it has a motion sensor standard instead of the shock sensor. 
The shock sensor is better....and the Viper shock sensor is better (2 cycle)
than the optional Alpine one, IMHO.  I think the Viper gives you a lot of good
value for the money.  But it isn't absolutely tamperproof.  No system is. 
Except maybe the one that James Bond had on his Lotus in For Your Eyes Only. 
Anyone know where we can get one of those installed?  Maybe that was what they
had in the van in the World Trade Center, huh?>

(km)another deranged fanatic who thought it neccessary to take a whole bunch of
(km)folks with him, children and all, to satisfy his delusional mania. Jim
(km)Jones, circa 1993.

I think there's plenty of evidence to the contrary - six ""rescued""
Davidians consistantly recounted that the Federal tank knocked over a barrel
of propane. These guys haven't exactly been spending time together,
plotting an elaborate and consistent story. It would be contradictory
for Koresh to go for ""mass suicide"" - remember that Koresh's death was
the opening of the sixth seal - the signal that Armageddon had begun.
His army (the people in the compound) would then fight the powers of
evil and win, ending in the Rapture. The fire wiped out his army. I
read earlier that Koresh was planning to walk out of the compound 
and blow himself up with a grenade - that would jibe better with
his teachings.

(st)In the mean time, we sure learned a lot about evil and corruption.
(st)Are you surprised things have gotten that rotten?

(km)Nope - fruitcakes like Koresh have been demonstrating such evil corruption
(km)for centuries.

I'd think you'd be the last one to support gassing people and 
burning them to death for their religious beliefs. Corrupt? Evil?
I don't know. We'll never know. And when you start calling people 
fruitcakes about their religious beliefs, that's dehumanizing people.
We saw what happened when many Germans started believing that Jews
were subhuman.

In one neat stroke, they destroyed all the evidence that could have

children whose last view of life was choking and pain, followed by
burning them alive.

I am extremely saddened that this tragedy occurred. I'm furious that
they used my money to do it.

For what it's worth, I got my can in three days from Chaparral. That's
UPS ground from CA to UT, YMMV. The stuff seems to work, and it doesn't
attract grundge like PJ-1 Blue does. I gave it the acid test, a full
day's worth of breaking in the Quadracer's new paddle tires down at the
sand dunes. If there's anything wet & stickey it will be coated with
sand at the end of the day, but the chain looked pretty clean.

As far as mail-order goes, if Chaparral has it in stock (and they can
tell you if it's in stock, or about how long it will take to back-order
it if it's not), I usually get it in three days. Competition Accessories
always seems to take a week or two to deliver. Motorcycle Accessory
Warehouse also takes a week or two, and after trying to buy some boots
from them last week, I don't think they actually stock anything. MAW was
about $30 cheaper than Chaparral on Alpinestars Tech 7 boots, but on
Monday I was hoping to get them by the end of the week, so I asked MAW a
completely unreasonable question: ""Do you have them in stock?"" The
conversation went something like this:

I need to know if you have some boots in stock.

	Do you want to pay with Visa or Mastercard?

I want to know if you have them in stock.

	Well, the computer doesn't show anything, I'd have to call the
	distributer to find out if we have them.

So do you have them or not?

	Don't you understand what I'm saying? I have to call our
	distributer to find out if we have them in stock or not.

Uh, right. So can you do it?

	Yea, call me back in an hour, and ask for Phil.

So an hour later Phil isn't there, but Mike says he'll check, and call
him back in half an hour. Half an hour later Mike isn't there either,
but he left a note that says they'll have them by the end of the month
(3 weeks away). Screw it, the 30 bucks isn't worth the hassle. I called
Chaparral and asked if they had them in stock:

	Ooh, Alpinestars? Probably not, they are hard to keep in stock,
	but I'll check. What size?

Size 10.

	Let's see, yes! Size 10, in blue & white, gray & white, black...

I'll take the blacks!

This was about noon on Monday, they arrived Thursday morning. Once
again, three days via UPS ground. I _like_ Chaparral.

I'm not completely down on MAW, they often have lower prices, but be
prepared to wait.

Oh, and if anyone's in the market for sand tires and other ATV stuff,
Scorcher seems like a good outfit, friendly, fast, had the tires I
wanted in stock, and were cheaper than Chaparral too.

I don't wish to rehash the PGP patent issue at all, but I do feel
that some potential misconceptions in interpretting intellectual property
laws need to be raised.

You are correct that executing PGP would be a violation (unless the patent
were declared invalid by the courts), but...  there is a question as
to when, how, or if distributing PGP would be a violation.  If the person
or company distributing PGP receives money for doing so, then it is
clearly a sale (for example, if it were on Compuserve, they charge you
for access so they would be selling PGP).  When there is no charge for
PGP things get less clear, but there would still be a reasonable view
that it is inducing an infringement.

This is a common misconception.  The patent laws do not mention any valid
purpose for infringing a patent.  Although it is clear that in order to
create a new invention either based on a prior patent or to avoid infringing
a prior patent, one must perform research on an existing patent.  To
just say that you infringed a patent (assume we're not talking the RSA
patent) only for research purposes (wink wink, nudge nudge) and then never
develop any related invention (ie. only use it), would be a clear
infringement.

Today marks the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide of
2.5 million Turks and Kurds in Eastern Anatolia and x-Soviet
Armenia. The following letter, which represents a small portion 
of the full text, along with more than 200 pages of historical 
documents, scholarly sources, eyewitness accounts and photographs, 
was sent to President Bill Clinton, members of Congress, editors, 
program directors and columnists of major newspapers, journals and 
radio/TV stations for the 78th anniversary of the Armenian genocide 
of 2.5 million Muslim people. On April 23 of every year, the people 
of Turkiye remember their dead. They grieve for lost family and the 
lost homes of their grandfathers. This year the Turkish Nation is 
mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their 
lives generously and with altruism, so that the future generations 
may live on that anointed soil of the Turkish land happily and 
prosperously.

------------------------- letter ----------------------------------

During the years of World War I, the x-Soviet Armenian Government 
has planned and perpetrated the 'Genocide' of the Muslim people, which 
not only took the lives of 2.5 million Muslim people, but was also the 
method used to empty the Turkish homeland of its inhabitants. To this day, 
Turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x-Soviet Armenia. In order 
to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic Turkish homeland, 
which is the crux of Turkish political demands, fascist x-Soviet Armenia 
continues its anti-Turkish policy in the following ways:

1. x-Soviet Armenia denies the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide
in order to shift international public opinion away from its political
responsibility.

2. x-Soviet Armenia, employing ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism 
Triangle, attempts to call into question the veracity of the Turkish 
Genocide.

3. x-Soviet Armenia has also implemented state-sponsored terrorism through
the ASALA/SDPA/ARF Terrorism and Revisionism Triangle in an attempt to 
silence the Turkish people's vehement demands and protests.

4. Using all its human, financial, and governmental resources, x-Soviet
Armenia and its tools in the United States attempt to silence through
terrorism, bribery and other subversive methods, non-Turkish supporters
of the Turkish cause, be they political, governmental and humanitarian.

Using all the aforementioned methods, the x-Soviet Armenian Government 
is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from
making the Turkish Case a contemporary issue.

Yet despite the efforts of the x-Soviet Armenian Government and its 
terrorist and revisionist organizations, in the last decades, thanks 
to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically 
exterminated by the Armenians, the international wall of silence on 
this issue has begun to collapse, and consequently a number of 
governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition 
of the Turkish Genocide.

With the full knowledge that the struggle for the Turkish territorial
demands are still in their initial stages, the Turkish and Kurdish people
will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle, therefore the victims
of the Turkish Genocide demand:

1. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government, as the heirs of the Armenian 
Dictatorship, recognize the Turkish Genocide;

2. that x-Soviet Armenia return the historic homeland to the Turkish and
Kurdish people;

3. that the x-Soviet Armenian Government make material reparations for 
their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the Turkish Genocide;

4. that all world governments, and especially the United States, officially
recognize the Turkish Genocide and Turkish territorial rights and refuse
to succumb to all Armenian political pressure;

5. that the U.S. Government free itself from the friendly position it 
has adopted towards its unreliable ally, x-Soviet Armenia, and officially 
recognize the historical fact of the Turkish Genocide as well as be 
supportive of the pursuit of Turkish territorial demands;

6. that the x-Soviet Republics officially recognize the historical fact 
of the Turkish Genocide and include the cold-blooded extermination of 
2.5 million Muslim people in their history books.

The awareness of the Turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the
efforts to pursue the Turkish Cause is seen by the victims of the first 
genocide of the 20th century as a positive step. Furthermore, a new 
generation has risen - equipped with a deep sense of commitment, politically
mature and conscious, who determinedly pursue the Turkish Cause, through
all necessary means, ranging from the political and diplomatic to the 
armed struggle. Therefore, the victims of the Turkish Genocide call upon
all Muslims in the United States and Canada to participate vigorously in 
the political, cultural and religious activities of the 78th Anniversary
of the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Muslim people.

   Just a quick question. If Mary was Immaculately concieved, so she
   could be a pure vessel, does this mean that she was without sin
   and, therefore, the perfect (meaning sinless) female human being?
   Is this why she is held so highly in the Catholic Church despite
   it's basically patriarchical structure?

She was immaculately conceived, and so never subject to Original Sin,
but also never committed a personal sin in her whole life.  This was
possible because of the special degree of grace granted to her by God.

She is regarded so highly because of her special relationship to God,
and everything that flows from that relationship.

The Catholic Church sees her as the new Eve.  (The Fathers in the
early Church use this particular figure a lot.)

Eve is the mother of all the living in a genetic sense.  Mary is the
mother of all the living in the order of grace.  As sin came through
Eve, so Grace -- Jesus Christ -- came through Mary.

Slight semantical difference.  The LDS Church does own a heck of
a lot however.  They are the largest land holder in MIssouri
(where they think Christ will appear at the second coming).

I believe they also own some large beverage company like Pepsi
(that was why they had to take caffiene off of their ""forbidden
substance"" list).

Gaza and the idea of separation

The Israeli Left's inability to cope with the challenges it is
presented with by reality becomes obvious at those moments when
the reality does not line up with the expectations of the left. We
were able to see this clearly during the Gulf War.  Because of the
Palestinian's popular solidarity with Iraq, Yossi Sarid -
currently Minister of the Environment - made his infamous
statement: ""You look for me !"", i.e., I'am not making any more
efforts to speak with you. From Yossi Sarid's point of view,
Palestinian reality during the Gulf War was not the lengthy curfew
or the danger of hunger it brought with it, but whether or not the
Palestinians accepted what was acceptable to the party. Similarly
MERETZ, MK Deddi Tzuker, recently faced with criticism from
residents of the West Bank town of Beit Sahour over his
government's and his party's lack of action for human rights and
peace, responded by asking those present at the discussion whether
they would rather have a Likud government. From the Leftists'
perspective this is the best government because it is THEIR
government, regardless of what it does.

These members of the Israeli Left have already decided how the
future of the Occupied Territories will look, and they want to
dictate to the Palestinians how to get there. An essential step
towards this future is their participation in Yitzhak Rabin's
government, and from their point of view the expulsions were a
marginal byproduct of this ""government of peace"", which need not
disturb the routine course of events. Likewise the ""Rabinic""
policies in Gaza - the blowing up of houses with anti-tank rockets
and the significant increases in the number of persons injured in
the suppression of demonstrations - need not disturb it.

But the fact that reality is not as they would have it forces
itself upon them when a mob in Gaza falls upon a settler who has
lost his way, when a settler is stabbed by his Palestinian
workers, or when a Palestinian knifes people in the streets of Tel
Aviv. Then all hell breaks loose and the Israeli Left has nothing
to propose except separation: Let's cut ourselves off from the
Palestinians, let's build a fence so high that they won't be able
to harm us - this is the cry of the Israeli Left. Let us erect a
fence between us and the reality whith is the occupation.

Meron Benvenisti writes about this in Ha'aretz (4-3-93): ""...The
liberal Left. which does not differentiate between physical
separation and 'the future of the territories', must come to
understand that the regime of magnetic cards, exclusion of Arab
workers, closure, and curfew are instruments of enforcement
designed for the suppression of a population in revolt, and that
their ideological support for separation only provides
'humanitarian' arguments for the legitimization of the <status
quo>.

Enforced separation is carried out only to meet the need of the
ruling community, but it is only the ruled population which bears
its burden. [.....].

""Whoover thinks that 'out of Gaza first' is a liberal,
humanitarian idea had best contemplate the question of whether
this position is also moral. It is very easy to shake off
responsibility for this concentration of human suffering, and to
thus also disregard responsibility for it's creation. It is very
easy to erect a fence between Jewish and Arab neighborhoods in
Jerusalem, when this fence has a gate - the keys to which are at
the disposal of one hand - which opens to allow the Jews to pursue
all their interests, but is barred to the Arabs..."".

	One of the things I find intersting about pagan beliefs is
their belief in a feminine deity as well as a masculine deity. Being
brought up in a Christian household, I often wondered if there was God
the Father, where was the mother? Everyone I know who has a father
usually as a mother. It just seemed rather unbalanced to me. 
	Fortunately, my own personal theology, which will probably not
fall into line with a lot others, recognized God as a being both
without gender and posessing qualities of both genders, as being both
a masculine and feminine force. It provides a sense of balance I find
sorely lacking in most theologies, a lack which I think is responsible
for a lot of the unbalanced ways in which we see the world and treat
each other.

Steve I'm glad to see that you abandoned the preamble thing.  What; did
you do a word search to find Welfare somewhere else in the constitution?

[my comments and paraphrases in brackets]

Article I Section 8:  [in some ways the guts of the constitution]

The Congress shall have the Power:

1. To lay and collect Taxes, Duties, Imposts and Excises, 
       to pay the Debts [indebtedness as defined in the document]
       and provide for the common Defence [Defence as precisely defined]
       and general Welfare [as defined through the document, mostly in ways
                           [that limit the government.]
         of the United States; [but the above taxes shall be uniform through-
                               [out the U.S.]

    [so far the congress has been given the power to collect taxes uniformly]

    [ then ... ]

2.  To borrow Money [...]
3.  To regulate Commerce with foreign Nations, [interstate and Indian tribes]
4.  To [do uniform Naturalization and Bankruptcies]
5.  To coin Money, regulate the Value thereof, and [etc.]
6.  To [punish counterfeiters]
7.  To establish Post Offices and post Roads
8.  To [provide patents and copyrights]
9.  To constitute Tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court;
10. To define and punish Piracies and [etc.]
11. To declare War, [and etc.]
12. To raise and support Armies,[but for no longer than two years at a stretch]
13. To provide and maintain a Navy, [notice no time limit on this one]
14. To [make the rules for the army and navy]
15. To provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws [etc.]
16. To provide for [training of the army except for some state stuff]
17. To exercise exclusive Legislation [in D.C]
18. To make all Laws [necessary to execute the foregoing ""Powers""].

Your original instinct was right.  Looking to other nations for precedents
that support an expansive liberal agenda is much easier than looking to the
slim pickins found in the constitution.

I just ordered my 4DX2-66V system from Gateway.  Thanks for all the net
discussions which helped me decide among all the vendors and options.

Right now, the 4DX2-66V system includes 16MB of RAM.  The 8MB upgrade
used to cost an additional $340.

I have uploaded the most recent Windows drivers for the Cirrus GD5426 
chip based display cards to the uploads directory at ftp.cica.indiana.edu
 (file is 5426dr13.zip). They're very recent, I downloaded them from the 
Cirrus BBS (570-226-2365) last night. If you are unable to get them there, 
email me and maybe I can upload them to some other sites as well.  
I have a local bus based card (VL24 Bitblaster from Micron) but I think 
the drivers work with ISA cards (or at least includes drivers for them).

I found the new drivers to be a significant improvement over the 1.2 version, 
improving my graphic winmarks (v3.11) by about 2 million (7.77 to 9.88) 
although this could be the result of intentional benchmark cheating on 
Cirrus's part but I don't think so.

From Steve Gibson's (columnist for Info World) graphic card comparisons 
(also found at the cica ftp site under the name winadv.zip) I extracted the 
following for the sake of comparison:

							Wintach
             		Winbn3.11	Word	Sprsht	Cad	Paint	Overall
Steve's system:
486/33 VLB:
ATI Graphics Ultra Pro	  9.33		10.34	 20.78	8.28	14.90	 13.58

my system -
486sx/33 VLB:
VL24 Bitblaster		  9.88		 8.65	 11.71	18.84	15.40	 13.65


Its no Viper, but I think its a hell of a deal at about a third of the cost of 
the ATI card and when compared to the other cards included in Gibson's review.

Micron system owner's, I would be interested to hear your opinions on the 
DTC 2270VL local bus disk controller. My system came with a Maxtor 7120 
drive (120 MB) and at first was only giving me disk winmarks of about 16 Kb/s, 
I am now at 22 Kb/s. Is this about as good as it gets? I can't get a Norton's
sysinfo disk reading because the contoller intercepts the calls, at 
least that was what the program said.

    Maybe you are using the wrong amendment.  If someone were to seize
a safe containing your (paper) records, and demand that you produce
the combination, the applicable defense would be on grounds of
unreasonable search and seizure.  The police would be entitled to
subpoena documents relating to a specific matter, but any broad search
such as implied by impounding all your records would be unconstitutional.
In the case of the safe, they would probably get a locksmith and
assert that they ONLY examined documents covered by the warrent.
(Sure!)  In the cryptographic case, their only resort would be
rubber-hose cryptography.

    (This would also make a good ""mental experiment"" to use in
choosing escrow agents.  Would you trust this proposed agent with a
key to your hard disk?--or half the key for that matter.)

How would you deal with Arabs who ALWAYS threaten to drive you into the sea or
burn half your conuntry?  Would you talk nicely?  Would you say please?  You
wouldn't.  The language of the middle east is power and force.  Sorry - that
is the way it is now.  If you aren't strong, you go down.  Israel has to talk 
and act tough.  Notice, Israel talks and acts tough in battle, but is willing
to talk peace.

True - and they have brainwashed their people into thinking Jews are some sort
of monsters.  Arab non-recognition of Israel and support of war and terror
is also an important factor, wouldn't you say?

> 2) Israeli government is arrogant and none comprising.

What do you want Israel to do?  They are negotating? I'm sick of people calling
for Israel to withdraw from the territories now.  That's not realistic, don't
you realize that?  A solution must be negotiated.  It is on the table.  Have
patience.

I disagree, if for no other reason than that there are already other 
standards in place.  Besides, even if they restrict encryption on the NREN, 
who cares?  Most of the Internet is commercial anyway.  The NREN is only for 
geovernment and university research (read the proposals--it's a ""data

Two questions:

1)  You asserted that both the AR-15 and AK-47 are not suitable for
   ""real hunting"".  If you have no problem with hunting, or using
   self loading rifles for hunting, why did you say this?  If not
   for deer, then what about other, smaller game?

2)  When did I get the nickname ""NRA man""?  Notice I have never referred

   super-powers, like Spider Man or Powdered Toast Man?

Well, I was raised as an athiest, and eventually took on a theistic
view. However I try to be a rationalist as well as a theist. Anyhow,
I will try to make some comments on your observations, just to 
contribute some datapoints from a different perspective.

Religion _can_ be a crutch. Before going much further on that thread,
I would suggest that you take a closer look at the veriety of world
religions out there, though. There are athiestic religions as well as
theistic religions. There are religions that claim knowledge about
such things as an afterlife, and there are religions that make no such
claims. 

My perspective is that lots of people talk, but all that means is that
talk is cheap. When someone gives me substantial evidence about an
afterlife, then I'll start believing in one. In the mean while, my
religion deals with what we know exists, that is life here and now.

>Religion also describes things we don't know about the universe (things
>science has not yet described) and it also gives people a feeling of
>security... that if they just do this one thing and everything will be ok.

Again, some religions do, and others do not. Some religions teach people
that life is chaotic and to accept it for what it is.

>(they can't accept the fact that there are people who would rather accept

I'll tell you that I moved from an athiestic perspective to a theistic
one because I believe that I observed phenomenon that was better 
explained from the theistic perspective, while the athiestic perspective
could not explain it. However that does not mean that I'm willing to
accept a lot of fourth hand gobbly-gook that contridicts modern science
along with my theistic perspective.

I assume that it belonged to a deceased Plus or something. 

Could any simple modification turn it into a proper ADB mouse?

I haven't seen any mention of this in a while, so here goes...

When the Hubble Telescope was first deployed, one of its high gain antennas
was not able to be moved across its full range of motion.  It was suspected
that it had been snagged on a cable or something.  Operational procedures
were modified to work around the problem, and later problems have overshadowed
the HGA problem.

Is there any plan to look at the affected HGA during the HST repair mission,
to determine the cause of its limited range of motion?  Is the affected HGA
still limited, or is it now capable of full range of motion?

Well, I'm no expert, but all of the histories of Nazi Germany assert this. They
make reference to several scandals that occurred long before ""the night of the
long knives"". The impression that I got was that homosexuality in portions of
the SA was common knowledge. Also, a book (by a homosexual author whose name
escapes me at the moment) called ""Homosexuals in History"" asserts that Roehm
and Heines were homosexuals, as well as others in Roehm's SA circle.

>All the books say that Roehm and his associate, Edmund Heines,
>were homosexual.  I have been able to find nothing beyond that, and
>suspect this to be a sort of historical urban legend. 

Well, you're the one who is in Germany. If you don't believe the history books,
look up the primary sources yourself. Those of us outside of Germany do not
have access to these. You do. It seems to me that there were plenty of
documented instances - several scandals, the fact that on the ""knight of the
long knives"" several SA members (including Heines) were found sleeping
together, etc. Also I believe some people were complaining about the SA's
homosexual activities (seducing young boys, etc). The histories that I've 
read make a very convincing case. None of this sounds like urban legend to me. 

>(Irving, a
>notoriously unreliable historian, says that Funk, the Nazi finance
>minister, was homosexual.  He gives no sources.)

I know next to nothing about Irving and nothing about Funk. What precisely do
you know, that would contradict all of the other history books that I have
read concerning the existence of homosexual Nazis? Are you trying to say that 
all historians are taking part in an anti-homosexual smear? What about 
homosexual writers who agree with the official history? Don't you think they 
would have found out the truth by now if Roehm and Heines were not homosexuals?
I would think they would want to disassociate homosexuality from Nazism. No one 
should use any connection between the two to bash homosexuals in any case. 

>I challenge anyone to document this claim.

If you are going to challenge *all* historians on this point (not just Irving),
then the burden of proof is on you. Track down the references. Find out where
the stories originate from. Again, you are the one in Germany, close to
archival material - most people on the net are not.

>I *have* found a great
>deal of evidence that there were many flaming heterosexuals among the
>Nazis.  This seems to include all of the worst ones--Hitler, Himmler,
>Goebbels, Goering, Heydrich, Eichmann, and many more.

Eh? What is your agenda here? To prove that the Nazis were heterosexuals, so
that you can bash heterosexuals? Does it bother you that some of the Nazis
might have been homosexuals? Does this make all homosexuals bad if this is
true? Of course not. And what about bisexuals? Are they half-Nazis?

I don't know why it would be so difficult to believe that some Nazis were
homosexuals. The German officer corps before WW1, for instance, was notorious
for its homosexuality. There were numerous scandals which rocked the German
govt. during the late 19th and early 20th century. Many of the Kaiser's friends
were prosecuted - the Kaiser was no homosexual, but the Germany army had a long
tradition of tolerating homosexuality, going far back into Prussian history -
back to Frederick the Great at least, who was himself a homosexual. Roehm was a 
product of this Prussian officer tradition, and the old German army (like the
English public school system), being a well known center of homosexuality,
would have been quite willing to overlook Roehm's homosexuality.

In addition, some Nazis complained of homosexuality in the Hitler Youth. The
Hitler Youth swallowed up all pre-Nazi youth groups, and some of the various 
pre-war Vandervogel, Bund, and Volkish youth groups were known to promote 
homoerotic ideals and friendship, and in many cases, homosexuality itself. So 
it seems to me not unlikely that there were plenty of homosexual Nazis, 
regardless of the official Nazi dogmas concerning the ""evils"" of homosexuality.
Why should this suprise anyone? Homosexuality has always existed, in all 
societies - it would be most unusual if the Nazis were an exception.

No, I don't have any sources for you, as I think the only kind of proof you
will accept would be citations from archival material, and I do not have access 
to these. Nor do I intend to reread every book on the Nazis and on modern
homosexuality that I have ever read - I don't have the time. Nothing is
stopping you, however, from chasing down those sources. Until you prove
otherwise, though, I will stick with the established histories.

John E. King (king@ctron.com) posts a whopping one liner:

 * ""The modern theory of evolution is so inadequate that it deserves to be *
 *  treated as a matter of faith."" -- Francis Hitching                     *

  I have a few points to make about the above posting.

    1. Science is not based on and does not consist of ""quotes"" from either
    real or alleged experts.  Critical reasoning, evidence and (if possible)
    experimentation are necessary.  Creationists frequently display a massive
    confusion about this by merely quoting both non-experts and experts alike
    (some of the latter quotes are in fact false) and steadfastly refusing to
    follow any kind of rigorous scientific procedure.  This strongly suggests
    that (a.) their claims completely lack any scientific merit and (b.) they
    are aware of this fatal deficiency.  Of course, you may not actually be a
    creationist and this may not be your real intent.

    2. You have failed to identify Hitching and the surrounding context of his
    statement.  Why is that?  If Hitching is a scientific illiterate then the
    quote would merely display his profound ignorance of evolutionary biology.
    Creationists are frequently known to quote real scientists out of context
    and to fabricate statements that they subsequently attribute to legitimate
    scientists.  Of course, you may not actually be a creationist and this may
    not be your real intent.

    3. Evidence supporting the alleged inadequacies of ""the modern theory of
    evolution"" would be a much more powerful argument than a contextless one
    line quote from an unidentified nobody.  It is also important to note that
    disproving biological evolution does not automatically prove some alternate
    claims any more that disproving that the earth is shaped like a hockey puck
    proves that it is a hyperbolic paraboloid.  Creationists seem rather fond
    of diving (head first) into this logical fallacy.  Of course, you may not
    actually be a creationist and this may not be your real intent.

    4. Since evolution is central to virtually all of modern science, an attack
    on evolution (either the fact or the theory) really represents an attack on
    science.  While the theory will unquestionably continue to evolve (B^) the
    fact of evolution will not ever go away.  Creationists lost the battle long
    ago (more than 100 years in fact) but are simply too willfully ignorant and
    irrational to acknowledge the fact.  Of course, you may not actually be a
    creationist and you may not really be that ignorant.


Warren Kurt vonRoeschlaub (kv07@IASTATE.EDU) asks:

 * Neither I, nor Webster's has ever heard of Francis Hitchings.  Who is he? *

  I, like Hitchings, am not to be found in Webster's B^).  Francis Hitchings
is a scientifically illiterate creationist (or perhaps he is just playing the
part of one) who wrote a quite ignorant book attacking evolution (""The Neck of
the Giraffe"").  In that publication he quotes a creationist (Jean Sloat Morton)
using the standard invalid creationist probability argument that proteins could
not have formed by chance.  Thus not only confusing abiogenesis with evolution
(the two are quite independent) but also concluding with a ""non sequitur"" (i.e.
the conclusion ""does not follow""). [pp 70-71]  Hitchings also misquotes Richard
Lewontin in an effort to support creationism. [pp 84]

  Hitchings book was reviewed by National Park Service ecologist David Graber
in the Los Angeles Times (and repeated in the Oregonian).  The article was
titled ""`Giraffe' sticks scientific neck out too far"".  Excerpts include :

  ""Francis Hitchings is not a biologist.""  ""He goes after Darwin like Mark
  Antony after Brutus.  He flips from scientific reasoning to mysticism and
  pseudo-science with the sinuosity of a snake-oil salesman.""  ""He suggests
  a mystical `organizing principle' of life, using the similarity of organs
  in different creatures as evidence [sic].""

  Note that the last statement above is actually evidence FOR evolution not
against it.  If John E. King is quoting from this reviewed book it wouldn't
surprise me much.  It's also interesting that King had nothing to add (i.e.
he only posted a quote).

The most likely explanation may have something to do with the fact that a
greater density of information exists on the larger capacity disk drive than
the smaller one. If your running the drive on a Mac I would recommend a
shareware utility called Timedrive which tests seek, SCSI throughput and
rotational speed. This utility should let you know what the differences are
between the drives.

As David Veal points out, this sort of ""promotion"" would be used
against gun owners by the mass media.

However, here is my proposal: offer gun safety classes in your area,
free, as a community service.  Such a class would normally cost $40
or $50, so offering it free is a good promotion.

Our Gun Club has organized several of these (we just finished
teaching another one last night, in fact) and they have been
very well received.  We get a lot of people who are novices
interested in guns.  We even get a few who are anti-gun, but
feel they should know something about ""gun safety"" since members
of their family keep guns at home.

Teaching such a course gives us many desirable benefits:

(1) We have the chance to teach gun safety rules; this increases
    firearm awareness and may help to reduce gun accident stats.

(2) A ""gun safety"" class is Politically Correct, and likely to
    be viewed positively by the public and the media.

(3) Most of the students are 'normal people' (not gun enthusiasts)
    and this kind of class gives us the chance to give them a
    gentle introduction to firearms.

(4) Some of the students are enthusiastic, and will purchase a gun
    and become more involved in shooting or personal defense.

(5) It improves the public perception of our club and gun owners
    in general.  Our students see that we are all reasonable,
    non-aggressive, soft-spoken people, which helps to mitigate
    the standard image of a hardcore gun owner.  Even anti-gun
    students sometimes tell us they have ""something new to think
    about"" with regards to personal gun ownership.

(6) Sharing our experience with others is a lot of fun.

Our course is the standard NRA-certified ""Home Firearm Safety""
class, and our students pay only $5 for materials.  We also
teach the NRA's ""Personal Protection"" class, although the cost
is higher for that one since we have to purchase range time.

I think firearms safety classes are an excellent response to
gun buy-backs.

My father is a huge Tiger fan, and I am a loyal Blue Jay fan, who endured the collapse of 87, the heartbreak of 85.  

I don't have the stat book, so let's throw them out.

First of all, Morris in his heyday (81-88) vs Clemens (86-present).

How many Cy Youngs does Morris have?

How many Cy youngs does Clemens have?

Ballparks and such... Fenway average pitchers park.  Detroit, hugh hitters
paradise.   

Morris is a great team pitcher, sort of in the Doug Drabek mold.  
If Morris's team needs a well pitched game, as in Minn in 91, Morris
snaps the ball, and throw for Ks.  Otherwise, he just tries to get people out.

As for Clemens, in the Elias Stat Book of 1992, I believe
that Clemens has the best lifetime record for his team, as compared to
when he doesn't pitch.  How bad would the Red sox have been last year
without him?  Can you say 92 Phillies?

I believe Clemens is the better pitcher because of more power, and hsi
great tenacity.  Morris is among the guttiest pitchers I;ve ever seen,
but Clemens is in a class with Seaver, Carlton, etc.

is this the KX-P1124 you're talking about?  or is there a KX-1124, too?
I'll assume you just forgot the P....

this light is also the power light.....  on (not blinking) just means that
the power is turned on.  if you look at the panel, it should read

      POWER

      PAPER OUT

right?

don't know why it would do this, unless you're out of paper, that is.

>does not blink.

when you power up the printer, assuming it does have paper, the red power
light (which, when flashing, doubles as paper out) should light, and a few
seconds later, the green ONLINE light should come on.

hope this helps.....

One addition to this... I don't know if it applies to everybody.  For my
(Microsoft 400dpi) mouse to work with windowed DOS apps, I had to use the
driver that came with Windows (Version 8.20).  8.1 didn't allow me to do
it for some reason.

My wife had hives during the first two months
of her pregnancy.  My son (3 months old), breast-fed,
now has the same symptoms.  She has been to a skin-specialist,
but he has merely prescribed various medicines (one
each visit as though by trial and error :-))

Anti-histamines worked on both of them, but looks like
becoming less effective.

Are there other solutions?  Thanks.

Read your own newspapers.  I don't have the space to keep them all.  If I
kept enough records to be able to respond with a couple of pages of citations
every time some idiot said ""Nyaah nyaah, prove it, gimme a citation"", I
wouldn't have any space left in my flat.  It's enough work to track down
references to prove that George Bush really said atheists shouldn't be
considered citizens, or that Einstein wasn't a Christian, and those used to
get demanded every week.

And I suspect if I did track down the various issues of The Guardian which
have carried detailed reports on the subject, you'd dismiss them as ""liberal
propaganda"", just like Gregg dismisses the articles about Islam in The Times.

Did you miss Amnesty International's widely-announced report about torture in
China?  It was in the news a couple of weeks ago.  Oh, I forgot, that's just
liberal propaganda.  I mean, is it plausible that the country responsible for
the Tienanmen Square massacre would torture and kill people?  Naaah.  Forget
it.

Keep up the good work.  I'm sure China's ""Most Favoured Nation"" status will
be renewed in June, and you can feel really proud.

I'm afriad that's not true.  The monitor problem seems to occur whenever
the 15"" Mag monitor is put into 1024x768 mode.  I'm running OS/2 at 1024 and
the same symptoms appear.

It does not seem like a video card problem as the Cirrus Logic 5426 chip and
the ATI GUP seem to cause these problems... two VERY  different cards.

We had a similar problem in converting a .EPS file. The solution was simple.
We changed the first line from %!PS-Adobe-3.0 to

%!PS-Adobe-2.0

This fouled the converter, the .EPS file only contained very simple 
move and draw statements.

.. actually from Alistair Scott
afs@tauon.ph.unimelb.edu.au

I have come across a old external hard disk and I can't find
any specs for it anywhere...

It is made by NEC (yes I tried tech support.... no help), and it
has a model number APC-H27C and is labelled ""Expansion Hard Disk""

Can anyone help me out with figuring out what this beast is.
The external connector looks like a scsi plug, and the date on the 
drive chassis is 1984... os it's pretty old.

I just want to see what it is, before I deep six it or rip it 
apart for bits.

Does anybody know how to implement wordwrap with use of XDrawImageString?
The problem is that I don't know how many characters can be drawn in 
a region. Have I to calculate character for character the width of the drawn
text?

Why not?  It hasn't been released, so there's no way for you to evaluate it 
yet.  After all, Apple could have been smart and had AOCE use an MD5 hash 
encrypted with RSA, just like PKCS signatures.  They could even be actually

information is available, before passing judgement on it?

AOCE's algorithm's aren't secret because Apple's being fascistic--AOCE itself 
remains secret (except for Apple demos at MacWorld :)), simply because it's 
not done yet.

It may be flawed, and it may not.  However, you can't tell which until you 
actually see it.  I, at least, am quite impressed with what I have seen so 
far, and have no expectation of being disappointed.

I work in a campus bookstore and we had the opportunity to demo the Color

Scanner.  I found it to be very impressive as well as affordable (with the
 educational discount of course!).  Note also that it comes with Ofoto

which is sufficient for our needs.

For many atheists, the lack of belief in gods is secondary to an
epistemological consideration:  what do we accept as a reliable way of
knowing?  There are no known valid logical arguments for the existence
of gods, nor is there any empirical evidence that they exist.  Most
philosophers and theologians agree that the idea of a god is one that
must be accepted on faith.  Faith is belief without a sound logical
basis or empirical evidence.  It is a reliable way of knowing?
 
There is probably nothing else most people would accept in the absence
of any possibility of proof.  Even when we agree to take someone elses
word ""on faith"", we just mean that having found this person to be
reliable in the past, we judge him likely to be a reliable source now.
If we find faith less reliable than logic and empirical evidence
everywhere else, why assume it will provide reliable knowledge about
gods?
 
The difference between the atheist and the theist is fundamentally then
one of whether or not faith is held to be a reliable way of knowing,
rather than, as some agnostic posters would have it, whether ones faith
is in gods or no gods.  The theist believes that faith is an acceptable
basis for a belief in gods, even if he rejects faith as reliable at
other times, for example in his work as a scientist.  The atheist
believes that only logic and empirical evidence lead to reliable
knowledge.  Agnosticism seems to me a less defensible position than
theism or atheism, unless one is a sceptic in regards to all other
knowledge.  Without evidence, why should we believe in gods rather than
Santa Claus or the Easter Bunny?
 
I would also like to point out as others have that the atheist doesn't
require absolute knowledge of the lack of gods.  I don't believe that
there is any such thing as absolute knowledge.  Atheism is the best and
simplest theory to fit the (lack of) facts and so should be held until
contrary evidence is found.

There's this minor thing called ""interest of finality/repose"".  What
it means is that parties aren't dragged into court over and over again
because the losing side ""discovers"" some ""new"" evidence.  I don't know
about you, Brett, but I suspect GM had the resources to find just
about as many expert and fact witnesses as it wanted before the trial
started.  Letting them re-open the case now is practically an
invitation to every civil litigant on earth to keep an ace in the hole
in case the verdict goes against him.

BTW, in federal criminal cases, Rule 33 does permit a motion for a new
trial ""based on . . . *newly discovered* evidence"" if made within 2
years of the verdict.  (Emphasis mine.)  If you're trying to make a
backhanded point about criminal justice in a discussion that has
little to do with criminal trials -- as the estimable David Brock did
in his amusing WSJ piece last week -- save your breath.

Yup.  Which is why they shoulda been brought around the first time

Unless there's some reason to believe that this supposed bias predated
the trial (as opposed to being a product of it), and that GM was
unfairly prevented from discovering it (by venireman concealment or
otherwise), why should GM be allowed to complain?

Actually not.  Brett himself has actually posted the data previously.
What declined from 84 to 89, as I remember it, was _percent
increase_in_deficit_growth, i.e. the rate of growth of the deficit 
(2nd derivative of total deficit with respect of to time) decreased.
Brett apparently has numbed himself into thinking that the deficit
declined.  If you keep spending more than you earn, the deficit keeps
growing.  If you keep _borrowing_ at a lesser rate than you borrowed
previously, the deficit increases.  You only decrease deficits when your
income exceeds spending and you use the difference to pay off debts.

Figgie's book paints the real data, pictorially, in gory detail.  Each
president, essentially ran up twice as much total debt, in half the time.
Reagan/congress was simply awful.  Bush/congress was unbelievable.

As a really rigorous aside to this thread.....

During pledge night the other night on the public channel, there was an
""economist"" who gave an hour or so presentation.  His data was predictive
and based largely on population data. I don't know his name, but his
arguments were brilliant.  He confirmed, with data, what many of us know
with common sense -- the boom of the 80's has nothing to do with government
policy, particularly ""supply side"" policy, since taxes do not ""cause"" 
economic activities.  People cause economic activity.  More can be 
explained by watching population waves roll through the years and 
create cycles.  He has made models and predictions for years well into
the middle of next century.  It will be neat to see how accurate he
is.

I just purchased a Viewsonic 17 and and Orchid P9000.  In short, I am happy
with the monitor and unhappy with the card.  I have spent a lot more time
futzing with the card, so that is what I am going to write about.  The monitor
is pretty.  The moires I had under Simcity on my 17"" Magnavox went away.  It
isn't as heavy as I thought it would be (45 lbs, I think).  So much for the
monitor.  On to the bitch session and test results.

In going with the modern trend, the Orchid P9000 card only supports 16 colors
in 640x480 mode without a driver.  Of course, this breaks any DOS program
which uses SVGA modes (like most of my CD-ROMs).  The Compudyne Whiplash VGA,
Orchid Fahrenheit 1280, and Orchid F. VLB all share this limitation.  Those
are all S3 cards, which means it is an S3 problem for them (the P9000 uses
a Weitek VGA chip which also doesn't support them).  The Hercules Graphite
card does seem to have these modes, but I didn't run the same test cases as
I did on the other boards during the brief time I had it.  It was able to
print the splash screen for the Grolier's Encyclopedia, though, which the S3
cards just printed as hash, which is why I suspect the SVGA modes are supported.

The supported resolutions really annoy me.  You can do 1280x1024 at 75Hz if
you tell the driver you have an NEC 5FG (they only have about six monitors
listed plus 'Generic', and if you choose Generic you can't get any high
refreshes at ALL).  But at 1024x768 you are limited to 70Hz.  Seems to me
that the hardware should be able to support the bandwidth (if it can do 75Hz
at 1280 it sure should be able to do it at 1024!).  Higher vertical resolution
was the main reason I bought the card over the Orchid F. VLB I currently have,
and it will do 1024x768x70 Hz as well.

The higher graphics modes all crash HP Dashboard.  I just got off the phone
with Orchid, and with the 1.1 drivers (I don't know what I have) he was unable
to recreate the problem.  On the plus side, their tech rep was as helpful as
he could be and booted up the program on his computer to verify he didn't have
the problem.  He didn't know why they limited the refresh to 70 Hz either.

The board is faster that the OFVLB for most things according to the Hercules
Speedy program. This program tests various operations and reports the results
in pixels/second.  I don't have the numbers for the Graphite card, but they
were close to half of the OFVLB (ie, slower) but that was running in a 20MHz
386, ISA, so the numbers aren't really comparable.  The following numbers
were all obtained using a 486, 33 MHz, AIR motherboard (UMC chipset), with
8 MB memory.  I give ranges because the program reports the numbers as it
computes them, and these tend to jump around a bit.

The DIB to Screen test takes a device independent bitmap of a face and transfers
it to the screen.  I have no idea what is being done internally as far as
conversions go.  The memory to screen takes the same face and copies it to
the screen, my guess is after it has been rasterized into a bitmap that can
just be copied to the video display.  The screen to screen test copies that
face from place to place on the screen.  Awesome!  Interestingly, the solid
vectors and shaded polygons show no improvement, and hatched polygons (ie,
filled with cross-hatching) and Ternary Rops (whatever they are.  Graphics
operations like XORs maybe????) are a dead loss on the 9000.  I give two
numbers for the 9000 fonts, because I think they are caching.
When the fonts are first drawn on the screen they are done fairly slowly --
1/3 the speed of the OFVLB.  Then the speed increases dramatically.  Sounds
like programming to a benchmark to me....

I make no claims that these numbers mean anything at all.  Its just what
I saw when I ran them on my computer.  I normally don't write disclaimers,
but this time maybe I'd better.  My testing is totally unconnected with my
work (I program under UNIX on Decstations) is done completely without the
knowledge, blessing, or equipment of my company.

You may have been emailed this, but the IIsi's power supply is not rated to
handle the GC board.  Remember when the si came out and everyone complained
about it's power supply.  This is one result of apple providing a low-cost
computer and I think they got a lot of flack for having a relatively high end
computer (at the time anyways) that couldn't even support their own video
board.  Even if this isn't what is causing your problems, you might develop
one later.

.  I have a STB-POWERGRAPH graphics card with 1024 X 768 by 256 colors,
with 1Meg RAM on it.

I have tried CVIEW097 (with windows-- EXTREMELY SLOW), and DVPEG24.
DVPEG24 doesn't work!  Even if I pick a lot of the ""modes"" that are
supported by POWERGRAPH (so it says in the manual), it doesn't work
when I try to view a picture... it only buzzes.

Anyone out there that can help me; give me suggestions?

I would really appreciate it!

0. Places to find the Resource Listing
======================================

This file is crossposted to comp.graphics, comp.answers and news.answers,
so if you can't locate it in comp.graphics, you're advised to search in
comp.answers or news.answers
(The latter groups usually are archived in your site. Contact your sysadmin
for more info).

These 3 articles are posted to comp.graphics 3-4 times a month and are kept in
many places (see below)

--

Many FAQs, including this one, are available on the archive site
pit-manager.mit.edu (alias rtfm.mit.edu) [18.172.1.27] in the directory
pub/usenet/news.answers.  The name under which a FAQ is archived appears
in the Archive-name line at the top of the article.
This FAQ is archived as graphics/resources-list/part[1-3]

There's a mail server on that machine. You send a e-mail message to
mail-server@pit-manager.mit.edu  containing: help in the Subject: field

--

The inria-graphlib mail server mirrors this posting (see under the
Subject 4: Mail servers )

--

The Resource Listing is accesible through WAIS in the machine
enuxva.eas.asu.edu (port 8000) under the name graphics-resources-list.
It's got a digest-type line before every numbered item for purposes of
indexing.

Another place that monitors the Listing is the MaasInfo files.
For more info contact Robert E. Maas <rem@btr.com>

--

Yet another place to search for FAQs in general is the SWITCH
(Swiss Academic and Research Network) system in Switzerland:

interactive:
  telnet nic.switch.ch [130.59.1.40], login as ""info"". Move to the
  info_service/Usenet/periodic-postings directory. Search in the
  00index file by typing ""/"" and the word to look for.
  You may then just read the FAQ in the ""faqs"" directory, or decide
  to fetch it by one of the following methods.

ftp:
  login to nic.switch.ch [130.59.1.40] as user anonymous and
  enter your internet-style address after being prompted for a
  password.

	cd info_service/Usenet/periodic-postings

mail:
  send e-mail to

RFC-822:
   archive-server@nic.switch.ch
X.400:
  /S=archive-server/OU=nic/O=switch/PRMD=switch/ADMD=arcom/C=ch/

Enter 'help' in the bodypart to receive instructions. No information
is required in the subject header line.


1. ARCHIE
=========

The Archie is a service system to locate FTP places for
requested files. It's appreciated that you will use Archie
before asking help in the newsgroups.

Connect to Archie server with telnet and type ""archie"" as username.
To get help type 'help'.
You can get 'xarchie' or 'archie', which are clients that call Archie
without the burden of a telnet session.
'Xarchie' is on the X11.R5 contrib tape, and 'archie' on comp.sources.misc,
vol. 27.

To get information on how to use Archie via e-mail, send mail with
subject ""help"" to ""archie"" account at any of above sites.

(Note to Janet/PSS users -- the United Kingdom archie site is
accessible on the Janet host doc.ic.ac.uk [000005102000].
Connect to it and specify ""archie"" as the host name and ""archie"" as
the username.)

==========================================================================

2. Notes
========
(Excerpted from the FAQ article)

Please do *not* post or mail messages saying ""I can't FTP, could
someone mail this to me?""  There are a number of automated mail servers
that will send you things like this in response to a message.

There are a number of sites that archive the Usenet sources newsgroups
and make them available via an email query system.  You send a message
to an automated server saying something like ""send comp.sources.unix/fbm"",
and a few hours or days later you get the file in the mail.

4. Mail servers and graphics-oriented BBSes
===========================================

Please check first with the FTP places above, with archie's help.
Don't overuse mail servers.

There are some troubles with wrong return addresses. Many of these
mail servers have a command like
   path a_valid_return_e-mail_address
to get a hint for sending back to you stuff.

DEC's FTPMAIL
-------------
  Send a one-line message to ftpmail@decwrl.dec.com WITHOUT a Subject: field,
  and having a line containing the word 'help'.
  You should get back a message detailing the relevant procedures you
  must follow in order to get the files you want.

  Note that the ""reply"" or ""answer"" command in your mailer will not work
  for this message or any other mail you receive from FTPMAIL.  To send
  requests to FTPMAIL, send an original mail message, not a reply.
  Complaints should be sent to the ftpmail-request@uucp-gw-2.pa.dec.com
  address rather than to postmaster, since DECWRL's postmaster is not
  responsible for fixing ftpmail problems.

BITFTP
------
  For BITNET sites ONLY, there's BITFTP@PUCC.
  Send a one-line 'help' message to this address for more info.


+RED
+---
+  RED - Listserv Redirector is essentially a mail server.
+  The Server Sites that are available are:
+

Lightwave 3D mail based file-server
-----------------------------------
  A mail based file server for 3D objects, 24bit JPEG images, GIF images
  and image maps is now online for all those with Internet mail access.
  The server is the official archive site for the Lightwave 3D mail-list
  and contains many PD and Shareware graphics utilities for
  several computer platforms including Amiga, Atari, IBM and Macintosh.

  The server resides on a BBS called ""The Graphics BBS"".  The BBS is
  operational 24 hours a day 7 days a week at the phone number of +1
  908/469-0049.  It has upgraded its modem to a Hayes Ultra 144
  V.32bis/V.42bis, which has speeds from 300bps up to 38,400bps.

  If you would like to submit objects, scenes or images to the server,
  please pack, uuencode and then mail the files to the address:
  server@bobsbox.rent.com.

  For information on obtaining files from the server send a mail message
  to the address file-server@graphics.rent.com with the following in
  the body of the message:
    HELP
    /DIR
  And a help file describing how to use the server and a complete
  directory listing will be sent to you via mail.

[ Now it includes the Cyberware head and shouders in TTDDD format! Check it
 out, only if you can't use FTP! -- nfotis ]

INRIA-GRAPHLIB
--------------
  Pierre Jancene and Sabine Coquillart launched the inria-graphlib mail
  server a few months ago.

    echo help | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will give you a quick summary of what inria-graphlib contains and 
  how to browse among its files.

    echo send contents | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the extended summary.

  As an other example :

    echo send cgrl from Misc | mail inria-graphlib@inria.fr

  will return the Computer Graphics Resource Listing mirrored from
  comp.graphics.

BBSes

7. Scene description languages
==============================

NFF
---
  Neutral file format , by Eric Haines. Very simple, there are some
  procedural database generators in the SPD package, and many objects
  floating in various FTP sites. There's also a previewer written in
  HP Starbase from E.Haines. Also there's one written in VOGLE, so you can
  use any of the devices VOGLE can output on.
  (Check in sites carrying VOGLE, like gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au)

OFF
---
  Object file format, from DEC's Randy Rost (rost@kpc.com).
[ The object archive server seems to be mothballed. In a future version,
 I'll remove the ref. to it -- nfotis ]

  Available also through their mail server. To obtain help about using this
  service, send a message with a ""Subject:"" line containing only the word
  ""help"" and a null message body to: object-archive-server@decwrl.dec.com.
  [For FTP places to get it, see in the relevant place]. There's an OFF
  previewer for SGI 4D machines, called off-preview in
  godzilla.cgl.rmit.oz.au . There are previewers for xview and sunview,
  also on gondwana.

TDDD
----
It's a library of 3D objects with translators to/from OFF, NFF,
Rayshade, Imagine or vort objects.
Edited copy of the announcement follows (from Raytracing News, V4,#3):

  New Library of 3D Objects Available via FTP, by Steve Worley
  (worley@cup.portal.com)

  I have assembled a set of over 150 3D objects in a binary format
  called TDDD. These objects range from human figures to airplanes,
  from semi-trucks to lampposts.  These objects are all freely
  distributable, and most have READMEs that describe them.

  In order to convert these objects to a human-readable format, a file
  with the specification of TDDD is included in the directory with the
  objects. There is also a shareware system called TTDDDLIB (officially
  on hubcap.clemson.edu) that will convert (ala PBM+) to/from various
  object formats : Imagine TTDDD (extension of TDDD?), OFF, NFF,
  Rayshade 4.0, or vort. Source included for Amiga/Unix as executables
  for the Amiga. Also outputs Framemaker MIF files and isometric views
  in Postscript.

P3D
---
  From Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center. The P3D uses lisp with slight
  extensions to store three-dimensional models. A simple lisp
  interpreter is included with the P3D release, so there is no need to
  have access to any vendor's lisp to run this software.

  The mouse-driven user interfaces for Motif, Open Look, and Silicon
  Graphics GL, and the DrawP3D subroutine library for generating P3D
  without ever looking at the underlying Lisp.

  The P3D software currently supports nine renderers.  They are:
  Painter - Painter's Algorithm, Dore, Silicon Graphics Inc. GL language,
  Generic Phigs, Sun Phigs+, DEC Phigs+, Rayshade, ART ray tracer (from
  VORT package) and Pixar RenderMan.

  The code is available via anonymous FTP from the machines
  ftp.psc.edu, directory pub/p3d, and nic.funet.fi, directory
  pub/graphics/programs/p3d.

RenderMan
---------
  Pixar's RenderMan is not free - call Pixar for details.

==========================================================================

8. Solids description formats
=============================

a. EEC's ESPRIT project 322 CAD*I (CAD Interfaces) has developed a
  neutral file format for transfer of CAD data (curves, surfaces, and
  solid models between CAD systems and from CAD to CAA (Computer Aided
  Analysis) an CAM (Computer Aided Manufacturing)

b. IGES [v. 5.1 now] tries to define a standard to tranfer solid
  models - Brep and CSG. The current standard number is ANSI Y14.26M-1987
  For documentation, you might want to contact Nancy Flower at
  NCGA Technical Services and Standards, 1-800-225-6242 ext. 325
  and the cost is $100.
  This standard is not available in electronic format.

c. PDES/STEP : This slowly emerging standard tries to encompass not only
  the geometrical information, but also for things like FEM, etc.
  The main bodies besides this standard are NIST and DARPA. You can get
  more information about PDES by sending mail to nptserver@cme.nist.gov
  and putting the line
	send index
  in the body (NOT the Subject:) area of the message.

  The people at Rutherford Appleton Lab.  are also working
  on STEP tools: they have an EXPRESS compiler and an Exchange file parser,
  both available in source form (and for free) for research purposes.
  Soon they will also have an EXPRESS-based database system.

  For the tools contact Mike Mead, Phone: +44 (0235) 44 6710 (FAX: x 5893),

Not any more.  About 2 years ago they all closed.
When Ramco/Electronics city closed, it took weeks and many
dumpsters to clear everything out (so I heard).
There are a few places that sell connectors and phone wires,
but no chips, capacitors or discrete stuff.

Sylvan/Wellington is still on Broadway and Canal, but they're
not cheap, and not surplus.  It's mostly a TV repairman's store.

As Ben says - this re-boost idea is all news to us here.  Do you know 
something we don't?  Please supply a source - it would be nice for 
the schedulers of observations to know where the thing is going to 
be.  These altitude numbers are also way off.  

My best source has: 
""Minimum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is:    573 Kilometers""
""Maximum ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is:    603 Kilometers""
""Delta   ST ALTITUDE in the PMDB is:      3 Kilometers"" 

(PMDB is Proposal Management Data Base - used to schedule observations.)

Could you supply some calculations?  You might check some recent 
postings that explained that 'a small booster' as suggested does 
not now exist, so comparing the mass of something that doesn't 
exist to the mass of the OMS fuel seems impossible.  The contamination 
threat also remains.

Tell me about it.  Although the arrays can be (and are) moved perfectly 
well utilizing the second electronics box.  Getting them both working 
is much desireable so as to reclaim redundancy.

  This neatly eliminates the need for a savior and ""proves"" that we can be
saved by works alone!  If we have no original sin, then it is possible for
us to save ourselves by not sinning.  I understand the reasoning behind your
argument, but it leads to sheer folly.  Original sin is the reason we need
faith to be saved.

I read a recent article in Personal Computer World mainly about the new
digit audion formats (DCC and MD) but at the end talked about how nice
it would be to use these for data storage with a brief calculation of
how much data you could store. The author had been talking to someone
from Sony about these formats and mentioned this to get the reply ""MD
is a purely audio format, we wouldn't use it for data"", then when
pressed for info about MO the Sony man basically admitted that it was
no more than a slight adaptabtion on MD!

What I think the original poster was wanting was MO drives at MD audio
player prices. I'd assume that the problem here is that an MD system
can have higher tolerances than an MO system as the ear doesn't pick up
the occasional bit error as well as an archiving program!

#I think that you are changing the meaning of ""values"" here. Perhaps
#it is time to backtrack and take a look at the word.
#
#value n. 1. A fair equivalent or return for something, such as goods
#or service. 2. Monetary or material worth. 3. Worth as measured in 
#usefulness or importance; merit. 4. A principle, standard, or quality
#considered inherently worthwhile or desirable. 5. Precise meaning, as
#of a word. 6. An assigned or calculated numerical quantity. 7. Mus. 
#The relative duratation of a tone or rest. 8. The relative darkness or
#lightness of a color. 9. The distinctive quality of a speech or speech
#sound. 
#
#In context of a moral system, definition four seems to fit best. In terms

#these definitions do not mean the same thing.

No, I'm using definition (3), or perhaps (4) in both cases.  If there
is no objective worth, usefulness, or importance then science has no 
objective worth, usefulness, or importance.  If nothing is inherently
worthwhile or desirable, then simple theories with accurate predictions
are not inherently worthwhile or desirable. Do you see any flaws in this?

If on the other hand, some things *have* objective worth, usefulness,
or importance, it would be interesting to know what they are.

#If you can provide an objective foundation for ""morality"" then that will
#be a good beginning.

I'm not willing to attempt this until someone provides an objective
basis for the notion that science is useful, worthy, or important in
dealing with observed facts.  Alternatively, you could try to
demonstrate to me that science is not necessarily useful, worthy
or important in any situation.   In other words, I need to know
how you use the term ""objective"".

Probably because there are many children there.  Also the minor fact
that other than defending themselves from 100 some people attacking them
they haven't threatened or attacked anyone outside the compound in
years.  Being a promiscuous religious nut does not constitute grounds
for a mass murder of Koresh and his followers.

Any lock including the Kyptonite utypes are EASY to break into if the person has
the proper supplies and/or motivation. 3 minutes and your bike is gone!
I would be glad to explain but I dont want to contribute to any unlawful
activities. Especially since I have a bike that I would hate to see ripped off
by such a trival tactic. WARNING NO lock alone is a safe deterent against theft,
the thief doesnt need to be a locksmith or a lock-picker to walk away with your
property!  I personally think motion alarms in combination to a lock
of this type is the way to go if in fact you are that concerned.

I have a 1974 Honda CB360T which for most of my purposes runs well. 
However I expereince a severe power drop at cruising speeds under load. 
That is, on a mild upgrade @ 50 mph in 4th or 5th I'm lucky if I can
hold speed.  If I try to add throttle much past 5000 rpm, power drops
drastically.  Put simply, under load, the engine won't rev past 5000
rpm.  The top third/half of the throttle range is dead.  Standing still
the engine runs fine up to red line (9-10K).

Other phenomenology: at about the point that power loss kicks in, the
engine becomes a little wavery.  That is, at a steady throttle the
engine speed goes up and down slightly.  The bike has about 13000 miles
on it and is in good tune, at least until it starts to balk.

I would appreciate any suggestions as to what's ailing the poor beast. 
My thoughts run toward clogged jets and/or improper spark advance.  I'm
hoping it's not something more drastic since the bike's not really worth
the hassle of any major engine work.

                                        Thanks,

When you say, ""By definition"", what exactly is being defined;
certainly not omnipotence. You seem to be saying that the ""rules of
nature"" are pre-existant somehow, that they not only define nature but
actually cause it. If that's what you mean I'd like to hear your

	Yes, it is.  It is available at ftp.ctr.columbia.edu, probably
in pub/xkernel.  

	In response to the earlier gentlemans question, you could
theoretically recompile xkernel on a sun4.  The binaries available are
for the sun3/50, but the author says it could be used on most
architectures, and he does have a 'do-it-yourself' type distribution.

	We use Xkernel for about 7 machines here.  email me if you

I thought Bill James' latest book completely and totally sucked.  I bought
it, but will not purchase anything of his ever again without THOROUGHLY
looking at it first.  What tripe.

The book is inconsistent, and filled with selective analysis.  James
claims to be looking forward, and then makes some absolutely bizarre
statements of value.  Not only that, but I got the impression he
probably glanced at the book for about an hour before he put his name
on it. 

To say I was disappointed is a grand understatement.

before the car is worthless while she maintains that the car may

Which one of us is right?  Are there MGB affectionados out there who are

Of course you could develope this system, but there is already a system called Global
Positioning Satellites.  It gives three dimensional coordinates anywhere on earth. 
Many surveyors use this system with a differential receiver/transmitter to get
coordinates within centimeters.  Basic receivers with resolution of a few meters (on
a good day) are available from many sources.

My family doctor and the physiotherapist (PT) she sent me to agree that the
pain in my left shoulder is bursitis. I have an appointment with an orthpod
(I love that, it's short for 'orthopedic surgeon, apparently) but while I'm
waiting the PT is treating me.

She's using hot packs, ultrasound, and lasers, but there's no improvement
yet. In fact, I almost suspect it's getting worse.

My real question is about the laser treatment. I can't easily imagine what
the physical effect that could have on a deep tissue problem. Can anyone
shed some light (so to speak) on the matter?

This is an excellent question and I'll be anxious to see if there are
any such cases.  I doubt it.  In the medieval period (esp. 10th-cent.
when Aquinas flourished) argument was a useful tool because everyone
""knew the rules.""  Today, when you can't count on people knowing even
the basics of logic or seeing through rhetoric, a good argument is
often indistinguishable from a poor one.

Sorry; just one of my perennial gripes...<:->

Hello Mr. Au,

I have to disagree regarding your assessment of Macintosh in Hong Kong. The Mac has a sizeable share of the typesetting market, as in the U.S. A local magazine, Next Magazine (similar to Newsweek here), uses the Mac extensively. I have seen Sir Speedy and other franchises in Hong Kong equipped with Mac-based systems. True, the discount is not as steep as here because customers in Hong Kong cannot buy from gray market, nor are Mac being sold thru mass merchandisers like Apple does here with the Performa lin


e. At this point the sale of Mac is handled by one exclusive distributor. On the other hand, you can always get a PC clone or in the earlier days, illegal clones of the Apple IIe.

Your perception of the Mac not being too popular in Hong Kong is simply because most hobbyists and users find it much cheaper to go to one of those basement stores that sell PC clones with probably illegal copies of BIOS than to pay for a Mac.

Similarly you cannot say Lotus 1-2-3 surely is not well accepted in Hong Kong because the sale is so low. May be it is because of all those places in Kowloon where illegal copies of Lotus 1-2-3 can be bought for $20 and $10 for a professional looking but illegal copies of the manuals.

H E L P !

I have  a problem in which I'm getting increasing frustrated every day...

Some background about my PC:

- American Megatrend BIOS (clone 386 SX) with 32M of RAM
- config.sys file:

	device=c:\dos\himem.sys
	dos=high,umb
	device=c:\windows\emm386.exe noems
	files=30
	buffers=30
	stack=9,256

- autoexec.bat file is using smartdrv.exe +c
- CMOS set up is running 0 wait state on read and write cache ram.

The problem: APPLICATION ERROR from WIN31

I started off with a newly installed WIN31 and then installed EXCEL.
Run excel, no problem. A permanent swap file of size 18K was in place
for windows.

Ok, I then proceed to install Norton Desktop
for Windows version 2.0. No problem with the installation. I also
allow NDW to alter my autoexec.bat(with the nav running on c:).
The problem came when I try to (bring up excel or if excel is running
and right in the middle of it - like click a selection with the mouse)
from the desktop.
First of all, I always get the application error screen followed by
another application error screen with various different messages. The
following are some of them:

- Stack fault, by TC1024.DRV at address 0001:XXXX where XXXX is some
  number. (TC1024.DRV is the VGA driver provided by the manufacture)
- General protection fault, by ndw.exe at the same address
- Segment load failure, by ndw.exe at same address

Some how, the address flagged was always 0001:something. What is address
0001:XXXX means? 

I have absolutely on idea what this mean. I tried commented out the
TSR programs from autoexec.bat, no help.

Is it something to do with the emm386 setup which is not telling
WIN31 what it suppose to know. Looks like the application is crossing
memory boundary when it is being loaded or while it is running.

Please reply if you have any idea or suggestion. I'm willing to try
anything.

It's just as meaningless to compare goals, assists, PIM and any other stat I
can think of.  Each player is asked to take a unique role for his team.  The
contexts will never be the same from one player to another playing on the
same team or different teams.  And yet ... awards are given and promotions
received based in part on these meaningless stats.  The operative words are
""in part"" - stats must be interpreted, tempered with other information one
has about the player.  


> To compare Jagr's and Francis's plus/minus is ridiculous and absurd...

And comparing Jagr's and Francis's points is just as ridiculous and absurd...
but not more ridiculous and absurd as comparing goals, assists, points, +\-
for Selanne, Lindros, Juneau, Potvin, and the other rookies in the league...
and yet...

How about looking at them for what they are and enjoy the game.

I don't think we should draw borders around newsgroups, christians
are free to read and post entries on the atheist newsgroups, and 
muslims are free to so so in other groups as well.

It's up to each individual to define their time schedule concerning 
postings. The problems we all have noticed on various newsgroups
is the evangelistical method of telling that 'I am right, and you are
wrong'. This is true of both theists and atheists.

Hopefully a more constructive dialogue between the groups 
would help concerning assumptions and colorization of views.

Cheers,
Kent

That still doesn't mean we should cheer their deaths.  Policemen are also in 
the line of fire and their job includes the possibility of getting killed.  
Should we be happy when they die?  As I said before, the question is not
whether or not you agree with the policies of Israel.  You may wish for the
Israelis to cease occupation, but don't rejoice in death.

Here is a press release from the Reserve Officers Association.

 Reserve Officers Say Demographics Ignored in Nominations to
Close Naval, Marine Reserve Centers
 To: National Desk, Defense Writer
 Contact: Herbert M. Hart of the Reserve Officers Association of
          the United States, 202-479-2258

   WASHINGTON, April 13 /U.S. Newswire/ -- The Reserve Officers
Association of the United States has alerted the Defense Base
Realignment and Closure Commission that the services failed to give
sufficient weight to demographics in recommendations made to close
56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve centers.
   In letters to the closure commission and to all 86 members of
Congress with affected locations in their constituencies, including
Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate Armed Services
Committee, ROA charged that the developers of the Navy-Marine list
ignored demographics of the civilian population, particularly prior
service personnel.
   ROA's executive director, Maj. Gen. Evan L. Hultman, AUS (Ret.),
suggested ""concern that the only plausible alternative is that they
are intentionally attempting to foreclose the Naval Reserve
components from maintaining even today's relatively low level of
participation in their parent service's Total Force of the future.""
   He asked the commission ""to remove from consideration all
locations without sufficient and convincing demographic data to
warrant approval of the requested action.""
   ""Only a few of the 56 Naval and Marine Corps Reserve
installations on this list are large enough to have a significant
impact on the community, if closed,"" wrote Hultman.  ""The major
issue is the cumulative impact of moving or closing such a large
percentage of the existing locations.""
   Hultman reminded the commission, ""The fact that the vast
majority of the Reserve installations on this list do not come
close to meeting the minimal requirements for consideration in this
process certainly supports the thesis"" that these actions are
simply an attempt to foreclose a substantial role for the Navy and
Marine Corps Reserve.
   ROA also noted ""that at the end of the 1960s, when the number of
Naval Reservists was approximately the same as today, there were 480
Naval Reserve facilities.  If the Navy recommendations are
approved, there will be less than 200 Naval Reserve facilities.""
   Facilities on the list include seven Naval Air Stations ranging
from South Weymouth, Mass., to Alameda, Calif., 28 Naval
Reserve Centers in Macon, Ga., and Parkersburg, W.Va., to
Missoula and Great Falls. Mont.  Naval/Marine Corps Reserve
Centers include four in San Francisco, Fort Wayne, Ind.,
Billings, Mont., and Abilene, Texas.
   A major Marine Reserve Center on the list is that at El
Toro, Calif., plus six others.

As am I

If ""high quality secure NSA classified technology"" means handing my key
over to whomever, I'll take PGP any day.

Right now they are billing it as voluntary, i.e. bend over, here it comes.

As soon as enough Wiretap chip based units are out there, how much
easier do you think it will be to redefine ""on your own"" to mean
write it yourself and don't even THINK about distributing it...?

Get honest, no one is going to buy this trash if they KNOW it's compromised
already, and less will buy it if the algorithm is not disclosed.

The NSA knows that making this stuff available to the public means
handing it to whatever foreign powers are interested in the process.

We`ve had the the Great Western, the [ dunno ] and the Great Northern
postulated as Brunel`s masterpiece. Keep boxing the compass chaps, you`ll
get round to it eventually.

The Great Western was a highly successful transatlantic mail ship,
with hybrid sail and steam propulsion. The Great Eastern, which broke
the 'Little Giant' financially and otherwise, was a revolutionary leap
forward in ship design. A thirty thousand ton all steel vessel, with
primary steam propulsion, it was at the time easily the biggest ocean
going vessel ever built. Brunel took advantage of the fact that cargo
and / or fuel capacity rose with the cube of scale, while drag rose
with the square, so a really big ship could steam thousands of miles
without coaling.

Unfortunately, there was no real market for such a beast at the time,
and it was eventually sold off at scrap values. As another poster
said, it then went on to a successful career as a telegraph cable
laying ship. It was in fact the only ship of its day capable of laying
a transatlantic cable in one go, with the endurance and capacity to
carry the huge reel all the way, and the manoeuverabilty to dredge for
defective sections. See Arthur C Clarke`s book ""How the World was One""
[ I think that`s right ]

If that`s how the Shuttle goes down in history, as a technical triumph
and a financial disaster for the builder, it would not be entirely
ignoble, but I doubt if history will be so charitable.  Its true the
Shuttle can do things no other launch system can do, but are they
worth doing? With low cost access to space, you could have an
affordable space station for doing shuttle-like extended manned
missions. As it is, the shuttle is not so much a space-truck as a
space-RV, ( only not so cheap to run :-( )

I am very interested in hearing from all of you who are using or implementing
3-D interactive applications what types of 3-D widgets you would
like to have in your applications.  

A 3-D widget is usually located in the same scene as other 3-D objects of the 
application.  It may let you

- manipulate application data, the camera,
  3-D objects in the scene and so on, or
- view the status of the application or 3-D objects
  via the widget's shape, color, position, orientation and so on, or
- do whatever I missed but you think is possible.

For example, a manipulative widget can be virtual trackball (shown as a
partially transparent sphere) super-imposed on the object to be rotated.
A feedback widget can be a ruler with ends anchored to 2 objects.  The length
of the ruler changes as the objects move and a numeric value is shown on the
ruler indicating the distance.  A widget can provide both manipulation and
feedback.  For example, the ruler can be used to change the distance between
the objects along its own axis.


Please e-mail me or post your opinions on 3-D interaction.  The information
I gathered will help me design a 3-D UI construction tool.
Your help is very much appreciated.

Check your facts....Andre dawson's career Slugging pct is in the .480's
So is Winny's I would like to see your facts. Winny has probably done  
better than 129 points above with a carrer SLG of 480. Check on more  
important stats. DEFENSE, and HEART. BATTING AVERAGE. RBI's

Peak, and career, especially career, Winny ranks in the top 15 outfielders  
of all time. You are using BS to make your standings. And I would like to  
know where you are getting your numbers from.

        Only guessing, but from his address I'd say that Jerry, like
        me, lives in Canada. Unlike me, he thinks that our friends in
        the US enjoy the same freedom that we do, and he has not seen
        the slow but steady erosion to the south of us.

        We have the benefit of relatively slow politicians and
        ineffective law enforcement. Our rednecks tend to be the
        objects of derision rather than elected officials. It's
        everything LE can do to keep up with the real criminals. Any
        time they actually go after somebody just because they don't
        like his or her attitude, it's national news (It also often
        blows up in their faces: eg. the well-intentioned but flawed
        Zundel case, which resulted in a scolding from the Supreme
        Court, not only to LE for prosecuting the case but to
        Parliament for passing the law it was prosecuted under).

        Our friends south of the border don't have as easy a time of
        it. Among other things they have as many LE agencies as we
        have agencies, and some of them have teeth. They also have the
        War on Drugs which gives law-enforcement agencies exceptional
        powers to ignore individuals' rights (the DEA has more
        arbitrary power than that given to Canadian agencies under the
        War Measures Act). We have the RCMP and CSIS who can't stop
        fighting each other long enough to do any really effective
        suppression of private citizens' rights. Not only that, our
        Police Commissions have teeth, as I learned when I had to fend
        off a bent cop.

        It may be ironic that the nation founded on Life, Liberty and
        the Pursuit of Happiness is getting government-imposed order,
        while the nation founded on Peace, Order and Good Government
        is getting in-your-face liberty.

        That's not to say our time won't come. It looks like Chretien
        is going to run on a law-and-order platform. Be afraid.

        Cheers,
                Marc

If people are going to do this, I really wish they would tell me first.
I'd be happy to go over the insert (in the PDR) with them and explain
everything.  All too many patients read the insert and panic and then
on the next visit sheepishly admit they were afraid to take the drug
and we are starting over again at square one.  Some of them probably
didn't even come back for followup because they didn't want to admit
they wouldn't take the drug or thought I was trying to kill them or
something.  What people don't understand about the inserts is that they
report every adverse side effect ever reported, without substantiating
that the drug was responsible.  The insert is a legal document to slough
liability from the manufacturer to the physician if something was to
happen.  If patients want to have the most useful and reliable information
on a drug they would be so much better off getting hold of one of the
AMA drug evaluation books or something similar that is much more scientific.
There are very few drugs that someone hasn't reported a death from taking.
Patients don't realize that and don't usually appreciate the risks
to themselves properly.  I'm sure Herman is going to ""go ballistic"",
but so be it.  Another problem is that probably most drugs have been
reported to cause impotence.  Half the males who read that will falsely assume
it could permanently cause them to lose sexual function and so will
refuse to take any drug like that.  This can be a real problem for
PDR readers.  There needs to be some way of providing patients with
tools geared to them that allow them to get the information they need.
I am involved in a research project to do that, with migraine as the
domain.  It involves a computer system that will provide answers to questions
about migraine as well as the therapy prescribed for the patient.
For common illnesses, such as migraine and hypertension, this may help
quite a bit.  The patient could spend as much time as needed with the
computer and this would then not burden the physician.  Clearly,
physicians in large part fail to answer all the questions patients have,
as is demonstrated over and over here on the net where we get asked
things that the patients should have found out from their physician
but didn't.  Why they didn't isn't always the physician's fault either.
Sometimes the patients are afraid to ask.  They won't be as afraid to
ask the system, we hope.

Fractal Landscape Generators
----------------------------

Public Domain:

  Many people have written fractal landscape generators. for example
  for the Mac some of these generators were written by
  pdbourke@ccu1.aukuni.ac.nz (Paul D. Bourke).
  Many of the programs are available from the FTP sites and mail
  archive servers. Check with Archie.

Commercial:

  Vista Pro 3.0 for the Amiga from Virtual Reality Labs -- list price
  is about $100. Their address is:
	VRL
	2341 Ganador court
	San Luis Obispo,
	CA 93401
	Telephone or FAX (805) 545-8515

  Scenery Animator (also for the Amiga) is of the same caliber with Vista Pro 2.
  Check with:
	Natural Graphics
	P.O. Box 1963
	Raklin, CA 95677
	Phone (916) 624-1436

  Don't forget to ask about companion programs and data disks/tapes.

  Vista Pro 3 has been ported to the PCs.


CIA World Map II
----------------
[  NOTE: this database is quite out of date, and not topologically structured.
  If you need a standard for world cartographic data, wait for the
  Digital Chart of the World. This 1:1M database has been produced from
  the Defense Mapping Agency's ONCs and will be available, together with
  searching and viewing software, on a number of CD-ROMs later this summer. ]

  Check into HANAUMA.STANFORD.EDU and UCSD.EDU (see ftp list above)
  The CIA database consists of coastlines, rivers and political boundaries
  in the form of line strokes. Also on hanauma.stanford.edu is a 720x360
  array of elevation data, containing one ieee floating point number for
  every half degree longitude and latitude.
 
  A program for decoding the database, mfil, can be found on the machine
  pi1.arc.umn.edu (137.66.130.11).
  There's another program, which reads a compressed CIA Data Bank file and
  builds a PHIGS hierachical structure. It uses a PHIGS extension known as
  polyline sets for performance, but you can use regular polylines. Ask
  Joe Stewart <joes@lpi.liant.com>.
  The raw data at Stanford require the vplot package to be able to view it.
  (was posted in comp.sources.unix). To be more exact, you'll have to
  compile just the libvplot routines, not the whole package.

NCAR data
---------
  NCAR (National Center for Atmospheric Research) has many types of
  terrain  data, ranging from elevation datasets at
  various resolutions, to information about soil types, vegetation, etc.
  This data is not free -- they charge from $40 to $90 or more, depending
  on the data volume and media (exabyte tape, 3480 cartridge, 9-track tape,
  IBM PC floppy, and FTP transfer are all available).  Their data archive
  is mostly research oriented, not hobbyist oriented.  For more information,
  email to ilana@ncar.ucar.edu.

UNC data tapes with voxel data
--------------
  There are 2 ""public domain"" tapes with data for the comparison and
  testing of various volume rendering algorithms (mainly MRI and CT
  scans). These tapes are distributed by the SoftLab of UNC @ Chapel Hill.
  (softlab@cs.unc.edu)

  The data sets (volume I and II) are also available via anonymous FTP from
  omicron.cs.unc.edu [128.109.136.159] in pub/softlab/CHVRTD

NASA
----
  Many US agencies such as NASA publish CD-ROMs with many altimetry data
  from various space missions, eg. Viking for Mars, Magellan for Venus,
  etc. Especially for NASA, I would suggest to call the following
  address for more info:

     National Space Science Date Center
     Goddard Space Flight Center
     Greenbelt, Maryland 20771
     Telephone: (301) 286-6695
     Email address:  request@nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov

  The data catalog (*not* the data itself) is available online.
  Internet users can telnet to nssdca.gsfc.nasa.gov (128.183.10.4) and log
  in as 'NODIS' (no password).

  You can also dial in at (301)-286-9000 (300, 1200, or 2400 baud, 8 bits,
  no parity, one stop). At the ""Enter Number:"" prompt, enter MD and
  carriage return. When the system responds ""Call Complete,"" enter a few
  more carriage returns to get the ""Username:"" and log in as 'NODIS' (no
  password).

  NSSDCA is also an anonymous FTP site, but no comprehensive list of
  what's there is available at present.

Earth Sciences Data
-------------------

  There's a listing of anonymous FTP sites for earth science data, including
  imagery. This listing is called ""Earth Sciences Resources on Internet"",
  and you can get it via anonymous FTP from csn.org [128.138.213.21]
  in the directory COGS under the name ""internet.resources.earth.sci""

  Some sites include:
  aurelie.soest.hawaii.edu [128.171.151.121]: pub/avhrr/images - AVHRR images
  ames.arc.nasa.gov [128.102.18.3]: pub/SPACE/CDROM  - images from
        Magellan and Viking missions etc.
        pub/SPACE/Index contains a listing of files available in the whole
        archive (the index is about 200K by itself). There's also an
        e-mail server for the people without Internet access: send a letter
        to archive-server@ames.arc.nasa.gov (or ames!archive-server). In the
        subject of your letter (or in the body), use commands like:

        send SPACE Index
        send SPACE SHUTTLE/ss01.23.91

        (Capitalization is important! Only text files are handled by the
        email server at present)

13. Background imagery/textures/datafiles
=========================================

 First, check in the FTP places that are mentioned in the FAQ or in the FTP
list above.

24-bit scanning:
----------------
  Get a good 24-bit scanner, like Epson's. Suggested is an SCSI port for
  speed. Eric Haines had a suggestion in RT News, Volume 4, #3 :
  scan textures for wallpapers and floor coverings, etc. from doll
  house supplies.
  So you have a rather cheap way to scan patterns that don't have
  scaling troubles associated with real materials and scanning area.

Books with textures:
--------------------
  Find some houses/books/magazines that carry photographic material.
  Educorp, 1-619-536-9999, sells CD-ROMS with various imagery - also
  a wide variety of stock art is available.
  Stock art from big-name stock art houses, such as Comstock,
  UNIPHOTO, and Metro Image Base, is available.

  In Italy, there's a company called Belvedere that makes such books
  for the purpose of clipping their pages for inclusion in your
  graphics work. Their address is:
	Edition Belvedere Co. Ltd.,
	00196 Rome Italy,
	Piazzale Flaminio, 19
	Tel. (06) 360-44-88, Fax (06)  360-29-60

Texture Libraries:
------------------
a. Mannikin Sceptre Graphics announced TexTiles, a set of 256x256 24-bit
   textures. Initial shipments in 24-bit IFF (for Amigas), soon in 24-bit
   TIFF format. Algorithmically built for tiled surfaces. SRP is $40 / volume
   (each volume = 40 images @ 10 disks). Demo disks for $5 are available.

   Contact:
   Mannikin Sceptre Graphics
   1600 Indiana Ave.
   Winter Park, FL 32789
   Phone: (407) 384-9484
   FAX: (407) 647-7242

b. ESSENCE is a library of 65 (sixty-five) new algoritmic textures for Imagine
   by Impulse, Inc. These textures are FULLY compatible with the floating point
   versions of Imagine 2.0, Imagine 1.1, and even Turbo Silver.
   Written by Steve Worley.

[ What about Texture City ?? ]

==========================================================================

14. Introduction to rendering algorithms
========================================

a. Ray-Tracing:
---------------

  I assume you have a general understanding of Computer Graphics. No? Then read
  some of the books that the FAQ contains. For Ray-Tracing, I would
  suggest:
   An Introduction to Ray Tracing, Andrew Glassner (ed.), Academic Press
     1989, ISBN 0-12-286160-4
  Note that I have not read the book, but I feel that you can't be wrong
  using his book. An errata list was posted in comp.graphics by Eric Haines
  (erich@eye.com)

There's a more concise reference also:

  Roman Kuchkuda , UNC @ Chapel Hill: ""An Introduction to Ray Tracing"", in
  ""Theoretical Foundations for Computer Graphics and CAD"", ed. R.A.E.Earnshaw,
  NATO AS, Vol. F-40., pp. 1039-1060. Printed by Springer-Verlag, 1988.

It contains code for a small, but fundamentally complete ray-tracer.

b. Z-buffer (depth-buffer)
--------------------------

A good reference is:

        _Procedural Elements for Computer Graphics_, David F. Rogers,
        McGraw-Hill, New York, 1985, pages 265-272 and 280-284.

[ More info is needed -- nfotis ]

========================================================================

15. Where can I find the geometric data for the:
================================================

a. Teapot ?
-----------

""Displays on Display"" column of IEEE CG&A Jan '87 has the whole
story about origin of the Martin Newell's teapot. The article also has
the bezier patch model and a Pascal program to display the wireframe
model of the teapot.

IEEE CG&A Sep '87 in Jim Blinn's column ""Jim Blinn's Corner"" describes
an another way to model the teapot; Bezier curves with rotations for
example are used.

The OFF and SPD packages have these objects, so you're advised to get
them to avoid typing the data yourself.  The OFF data is triangles at
a specific resolution (around 8x8[x4 triangles] meshing per patch).
The SPD package provides the spline patch descriptions and performs a
tessellation at any specified resolution.

b. Space Shuttle ?
------------------

Tolis Lerios <tolis@nova.stanford.edu> has built a list of Space Shuttle
datafiles. Here's a summary (From his sci.space list):

model1:
A modified version of the newsgroup model (model2)

406 vertices (296 useful, i.e. referred to in the polygon descriptions.)
389 polygons (233 3-vertex, 146 4-vertex, 7 5-vertex, 3 6-vertex).
Payload doors non-existent.
Units: unknown.

Simon Marshall (S.Marshall@sequent.cc.hull.ac.uk) has a copy. He
said there is no proprietary information associated with it.

model2:
The newsgroup model, in OFF format. You can find it in

gondwana.ecr.mu.oz.au , file pub/off/objects/shuttle.geo
hanauma.stanford.edu ,  /pub/graphics/Comp.graphics/objects/shuttle.data

model3:
The triangles' model.

This model is stored in several files, each defining portions of the model.

Greg Henderson (henders@infonode.ingr.com) has a copy.  He did
not mention any restriction on the model's distribution.

model4:
The NASA model.

The file starts off with a header line containing three real numbers,
defining the offsets used by Lockheed in their simulations:

<x offset> <y offset> <z offset>

From then on, the file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions

3473 vertices.
2748 polygons (407 3-vertex, 2268 4-vertex, 33 5-vertex, 14 6-vertex,
 10 7-vertex, 8 8-vertex, 8 12-vertex, 2 13-vertex, 2 15-vertex,
 17 16-vertex, 2 17-vertex, 2 18-vertex, 3 19-vertex, 8 24-vertex).
Payload doors closed.
Units: inches.

Jon Berndt (jon@l14h11.jsc.nasa.gov) seems to be responsible for the model
Proprietary info: unknown

model5:
The old shuttle model.

The file consists of a sequence of polygon descriptions.

104 vertices.
452 polygons (11 3-vertex, 41 4-vertex).
Payload doors open.
Units: meters.

We have been using this model at STAR Labs, Stanford University, for
some years now. Contact me (tolis@nova.stanford.edu) or my supervisor
Scott Williams (scott@star5.stanford.edu) if you want a copy.

========================================================================

16. Image annotation software
=============================

a. Touchup runs in Sunview and is pretty good.  It reads in
  rasterfiles, but even if your image isn't normally stored
  in rasterfile format you could use screendump to make it a
  rasterfile.

b. Idraw (part of Stanford's InterViews distribution) can handle some
  image formats in addition to being a MacDraw like tool.  I'm not
  sure exactly what they are.
  You can ftp the idraw's binary from interviews.stanford.edu.

c. Tgif is another MacDraw like tool that can handle X11 bitmap (xbm)
  and X11 pixmap (xpm) formats.  If the image you have is in formats
  other than xbm or xpm, you can get the pbmplus toolkit to convert
  things like gif or even some Macintosh formats to xpm.
  Tgif's sources are available in the pub directory on cs.ucla.edu
  (Version 2.12 of tgif at patchlevel 7 plus patch8 and patch9)

d. Use the editimage facility of KHOROS (see below).
  This is just one utility in the overall system- you can essentially do all
  your image processing and macdraw-type graphics using this package.

e. You might be able to get by with PBMPlus.  pbmtext gives you text output
  bitmaps which can be overlaid on top of your image.

f. 'ice' requires Sun hardware running OpenWindows 3.It's a PostScript-based
  graphical editor,and it's available for anonymous ftp from Internet host
  eo.soest.hawaii.edu (128.171.151.12). Requires Sun C++ 2.0 and
  two other locally developed packages, the LXT library (an Xlib-based
  toolkit) and a small C++ class library. All files (pub/ice.tar.Z,
  pub/lxt.tar.Z and pub/ldgoc++.tar.Z) are available in compressed
  tar format. pub/ice.tar.Z contains a README that gives installation
  instructions, as well as an extensive man page (ice.1).
  A statically-linked compressed executable pub/ice-sun4.Z for
  SPARC systems is also available for ftp.

  All software is the property of Columbia University and may not
  be redistributed without permission.

  ice means Image Composition Environment and it's an imaging tool that
  allows raster images to be combined with a wide variety of
  PostScript annotations in WYSIWYG fashion via X11 imaging
  routines and NeWS PostScript rasterizing.

g. Use ImageMagick to annotate an image from your X server.  Pick the 
  position of your text with the cursor and choose your font and pen 
  color from a pull-down menu.  ImageMagick can read and write many
  of the more popular image formats.  ImageMagick is available as
  export.lcs.mit.edu: contrib/ImageMagick.tar.Z or at your nearest
  X11 archive.

WIT
---
  In a nutshell it's a package of the same genre as AVS,Explorer,etc.
  It seems more a image processing system than a generic SciVi system (IMHO)
  Major elements are:

  - a visual programming language, which automatically exploits the inherent
        parallelism
  - a code generator which converts the graph to a standalone program

  Iconified libraries present a rich set of point, filter, io, transform,
  morphological, segmentation, and measurement operations.
  A flow library allows graphs to employ broadcast, merge,
  synchronization, conditional, and sequencing control strategies.

  WIT delivers an object-oriented, distributed, visual programming
  environment which allows users to rapidly design solutions to their
  imaging problems. Users can consolidate both software and hardware
  developments within a complete CAD-like workspace by adding their
  own operators (C functions), objects (data structures), and servers
  (specialized hardware). WIT runs on Sun, HP9000/7xx, SGI and supports
  Datacube MV-20/200 hardware allowing you to run your graphs in real-time.

IDL/SIPS
--------
  ""A lot of people are using IDL with a package called SIPS. This was
  developed at the University of Colorado (Boulder) by some people working
  for Alex Goetz.  You might try contacting them if you already have IDL
  or would be willing to buy it.  It's a few thousand dollars (American) I
  expect for IDL and the other should be free.  Those are the general
  purpose packages I've heard of, besides what TerraMar has.
  SIPS _was_ written for AVIRIS imagery.  I'm not sure how general purpose
  it is.  You would have to contact Goetz or one of his people and ask.  I
  have another piece of software (PCW) that does PC and Walsh
  transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image
  modification (you can compute an image using selected components).  I've
  used it on 70 megabyte AVIRIS images without problems, but for the best
  speed you need an external DSP card.  It will work without it, but large
  images take quite a while (50-70 times as long) to process.  That's a
  freebie if you want it""

  ""My  favorite is IDL (Interactive Data Language) from Research Systems,
  Inc.  IDL is in my opinion, much better and infinitely easier. Its
  programming language is very strong and easy -- very Pascal-like. It
  handles the number-crunching very well, also. Personally, I like doing
  the number-crunching with IDL on the VAX (or Mathematica, Igor, or even
  Excel on the Mac if it's not too hairy), then bringing it over to NIH
  Image for the imaging part. I have yet to encounter any situation which
  that combination couldn't handle, and the speed and ease of use
  (compared to IRAF) was incredible. By the way, it's mostly astronomical
  image processing which I've been doing. This means image enhancement,
  cleaning up bad lines/pixels, and some other traditional image
  processing routines. Then, for example, taking a graph of intensity
  versus position along a line I choose with the mouse, then doing a curve
  fit to that line (which I might do like in KaleidaGraph.) ""

[ For IDL call Research Systems , for PV-WAVE call Precision Visuals and
 for SIPS call University of Colorado @ Boulder . From what I can
 understand, you can get packaged programs from Research Systems, though

[ From the README : ]

      Scry is a distributed image handling system  that  pro-
 vides image transport and compression on local and wide area
 networks, image viewing on workstations, recording on  video
 equipment,  and  storage on disk.  The system can be distri-
 buted among workstations, between supercomputers and  works-
 tations,  and between supercomputers, workstations and video
 animation controllers.  The system is most commonly used  to
 produce  video based movie displays of images resulting from
 visualization of time dependent data, complex 3D data  sets,
 and  image  processing  operations.   Both  the  clients and
 servers run on a variety of systems that provide UNIX-like C
 run-time environments, and 4BSD sockets.

SVLIB / FVS
-----------
  SVLIB is an X-Windows widget set based on the OSF (Open Software 
  Foundation) Motif widget set. SVLIB widgets are macro-widgets 
  comprising lower level Motif widgets such as buttons, scrollbars, 
  menus, and drawing areas. It is designed to address the reusability 
  of 2D visualization routines and each widget in the library is an 
  encapsulation of a specific visualization technique such as colormap 
  manipulation, image display, and contour plotting. It is targetted
  to run on UNIX workstations supporting OSF/Motif. Currently, only 
  color monitors are supported. Since SVLIB is a collection of widgets 
  developed in the same spirit as the OSF/Motif user interface widget 
  set, it integrates seamlessly with the Motif widgets. Programmers 
  using SVLIB widgets see the same interface and design as other 
  Motif widgets.

  FVS is a visualization software for Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) 
  simulations.  FVS is designed to accept data generated from these
  simulations and apply various visualization techniques to present these
  data graphically. 
  FVS accepts three-dimensional multi-block data recorded in NCSA HDF format.

GVLware Distribution:
        Bob  - An interactive volume renderer for the SGI
        Raz  - A disk based movie player for the SGI
        Icol - Motif color editor
---------------------------------------------------------

The Army High Performance Computing Research Center (AHPCRC) has been
developing a set of tools to work with large time dependent 2D and 3D
data sets.  In the Graphics and Visualization Lab (GVL) we are using
these tools along side standard packages, such as SGI Explorer and the
Utah Raster Toolkit, to render 3D volumes and create digital movies.
A couple of the more general purpose programs have been bundled into a
package called ""GVLware"".

GVLware, currently consisting of Bob, Raz and Icol, is now available
via ftp.  The most interesting program is probably Bob, an interactive
volume renderer for the SGI.  Raz streams raster images from disk to
an SGI screen, enabling movies larger than memory to be played.  Icol
is a color map editor that works with Bob and Raz.  Source and
pre-built binaries for IRIX 4.0.5 are included.

To acquire GVLware, anonymous ftp to:
        machine - ftp.arc.umn.edu
        file    - /pub/gvl.tar.Z

To use GVLware:
        mkdir gvl ; cd gvl
        zcat gvl.tar.Z | tar xvf -
        more README

Some Bob features:
        Motif interface, SGI GL rendering
        Renders 64 cubed data set in 0.1 to 1.0 seconds on a VGX
        Alpha Compositing and Maximum Value rendering, in perspective
            (only Maximum Value rendering on Personal Iris)
        Data must be a ""Brick of Bytes"", on a regularly spaced grid
        Animation, subvolumes, subsampling, stereo

Some Raz features:
        Motif interface, SGI GL rendering
        Loads files to a raw disk partition, then streams to screen
            (requires an empty disk partition to be set aside)
        Script interface available for movie sequences
        Can stream from memory, like NCSA XImage
        
Some Icol features:
        Motif interface
        Easy to create interpolated color maps between key points
        RGB, HSV and YUV color spaces, multiple file formats
        Communicates changes automatically to Bob and Raz
        Has been tested on SGI, Sun, DEC and Cray systems

BTW:    Bob  == Brick of Bytes
        Icol == Interpolated Color
        Raz  == ? (just a name)

===========================================================================

19. GIS (Geographical Information Systems software)
===================================================

GRASS
-----
  (Geographic Resource Analysis Support System) of the US Army
  Construction Engineering Research Lab (CERL). It is a popular geographic and
  remote sensing image processing package. Many may think of GRASS as a
  Geographic Information System rather than an Image Processing package,
  although it is reported to have significant image processing
  capabilities.

  Feature Descriptions

  I use GRASS  because it's public domain and can be obtained through the
  internet for free.  GRASS runs in Unix and is written in C.  The source
  code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the Office of Grass
  Integration.  You then compile the source code for your machine, using
  scripts provided with GRASS.  I would recommend GRASS for someone who
  already has a workstation and is on a limited budget. GRASS is not very
  user-friendly, compared to Macintosh software."" A first review  of
  overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel
  resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose
  image enhancement routines (fft). Kelly Maurice at Vexcel Corp. in
  Boulder, CO is a primary user of GRASS .  This gentleman has used the
  GRASS software and developed multi-spectral (238 bands ??) volumetric
  rendering, full color, on Suns and Stardents. It was a really effective
  interface.  Vexcel Corp. currently has a contract to map part of Venus
  and convert the Magellan radar data into contour maps. You can call them
  at (303) 444-0094 or email care of greg@vexcel.com 192.92.90.68

  Host Configuration Requirements

  If you are willing to run A/UX you could install GRASS   on a Macintosh
  which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for
  satellite data. GRASS  is public-domain, and can run on a high-end PC
  under UNIX. It is raster-based, has some image-processing capability,
  and can display vector data (but analysis must be done in the raster
  environment). I have used GRASS V.3 on a SUN workstation and found it
  easy to use. It is best, of course, for data that are well represented
  in raster (grid-cell) form.

  Availability

  CERL's Office of Grass Integration (OGI)  maintains an ftp server:
  moon.cecer.army.mil (129.229.20.254).

  Mail regarding this site should be addressed to
  grass-ftp-admin@moon.cecer.army.mil.

  This location will be the new ""canonical"" source for GRASS software, as
  well as bug fixes, contributed sources, documentation, and other files.
  This FTP server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and
  ""tar"" archiving of files.  A feature attraction of the server is John
  Parks' GRASS tutorial.  Because the manual is still in beta-test stage,
  John requests that people only acquire it if they are willing to review
  it and mail him comments/corrections. The OGI is not currently
  maintaining this document, so all correspondence about it should be
  directed to grassx@tang.uark.edu

  Support

  Listserv mailing lists:

  grassu-list@amber.cecer.army.mil (for GRASS users; application-level
  questions, support concerns, miscellaneous questions, etc) Send
  subscribe commands to grassu-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.

  of GRASS applications) Send subscribe commands to
  grassp-request@amber.cecer.army.mil.

  Both lists are maintained by the Office of Grass Integration (subset of
  the Army Corps of Engineers Construction Engineering Research Lab in
  Champaign, IL). The OGI is providing the lists as a service to the
  community; while OGI and CERL employees will participate in the lists,
  we can make no claim as to content or veracity of messages that pass
  through the list.  If you have questions, problems, or comments, send
  E-mail to lists-owner@amber.cecer.army.mil and a human will respond.

Microstation Imager
-------------------
  Intergraph (based in Huntsville Alabama) sells a wide range of GIS
  software/hardware. Microstation is a base  graphics package that Imager
  sits on top of. Imager is basically an  image processing package with a
  heavy GIS/remote sensing flavor.

  Feature Description

  Basic geometry manipulations: flip, mirror, rotate, generalized affine.
  Rectification: Affine, 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 5th order models as well as a
  projective model (warp an image to a vector map or to another image).
  RGB to IHS and IHS to RGB conversion.  Principal component analysis.
  Classification: K-means and isodata.  Fourier Xforms: Forward, filtering
  and reverse.  Filters: High pass, low pass, edge enhancing, median,
  generic.  Complex Histogram/Contrast control.  Layer Controller: manages
  up to 64 images at a time -- user can extract single bands from a 3 band
  image or create color images by combining various individual bands, etc.

  The package is designed for a remote sensing application (it can handle
  VERY LARGE images) and there is all kinds of other software available
  for GIS applications.
  Host Configuration Requirements

  It runs on Intergraph Workstations (a Unix machine similar to a Sun)
  though there  were rumors (there are always rumors) that the software
  would be  ported to PC and possibly a Sun environment.

PCI
---
  A company called PCI, Inc., out of Richmond Hill, Ontario, Canada, makes
  an array of software utilities for processing, manipulation, and use of
  remote sensing data in eight or ten different ""industry standard""
  formats: LGSOWG, BSQ, LANDSAT, and a couple of others whose titles I
  forget.  The software is available in versions for MS-DOS, Unix
  workstations (among them HP, Sun, and IBM), and VMS, and quite possibly
  other platforms by now.  I use the VMS version.

  The ""PCI software"" consists of several classes/groups/packages of
  utilities, grouped by function but all operating on a common ""PCI
  database"" disk file.  The ""Tape I/O"" package is a set of utility
  programs which read from the various remote-sensing industry tape
  formats INTO, or write those formats out FROM, the ""PCI database"" file;
  this is the only package I use or know much about.  Other packages can
  display data from the PCI database to one or another of several
  PCI-supported third-party color displays, output numeric or bitmap
  representation of image data to an attached printer, e.g. an Epson-type
  dot-matrix graphics printer.  You might be more spe- cifically
  interested in the mathematical operations package: histo- gram and
  Fourier analysis, equalization, user-specified operations (e.g.
  ""multiply channel 1 by 3, add channel 2, and store as channel 5""), and
  God only knows what all else -- there's a LOT.  I don't have and don't
  use these, so can't say much about them; you only buy the packages your
  particular application/interest calls for.

  Each utility is controlled by from one to eight ""parameters,"" read from
  a common ""parameter file"" which must be (in VMS anyway) in your ""default
  directory.""  Some utilities will share parameters and use the same
  parameter for a different purpose, so it can get a bit confusing setting
  up a series of operations.  The standard PCI environment contains a
  scripting language very similar to IBM-PC BASIC, but which allows you to
  automate the process of setting up parameters for a common, complicated,
  lengthy or difficult series of utility executions.  (In VMS I can also
  invoke utilities independently from a DCL command procedure.)  There's
  also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled
  language programs which can interface with (read from/write to) the PCI
  data structures (database file, parameter file).

  The PCI software is designed specifically for remote-sensing images, but
  requires such a level of operator expertise that, once you reach the
  level where you can handle r-s images, you can figure out ways to handle
  a few other things as well.  For instance, the Tape I/O package offers a
  utility for reading headerless multi-band (what Adobe PhotoShop on the
  Macintosh calls ""raw"") data from tape, in a number of different
  ""interleave"" orders. This turns out to be ideal for manipulating the
  graphic-arts industry's ""CT2T"" format, would probably (I haven't tried)
  handle Targa, and so on. Above all, however, you HAVE TO KNOW WHAT
  YOU'RE DOING or you can screw up to the Nth degree and have to start
  over.  It's worth noting that the PCI ""database"" file is designed to
  contain not only ""raster"" (image) data, but vectors (for overlaying map
  information entered via digitizing table), land-use, and all manner of
  other information (I observe that a remote-sensing image tape often
  contains all manner of information about the spectral bands, latitude,
  longitude, time, date, etc. of the original satellite pass; all of this
  can go into the PCI ""database"").

  I _believe_ that on workstations the built-in display is used.  On VAX
  systems OTHER than workstations PCI supports only a couple of specific
  third-party display systems (the name Gould/Deanza seems to come to
  mind).  One of MY personal workarounds was a display program which would
  display directly from a PCI ""database"" file to a Peritek VCT-Q (Q-bus
  24-bit DirectColor) display subsystem.  PCI software COULD be ""overkill""
  in your case; it seems designed for the very ""high end""
  applications/users, i.e. those for whom a Mac/PC largely doesn't suffice
  (although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time).  It's
  probably no coincidence that PCI is located in Canada, a country which
  does a LOT of its land/resource management via remote sensing; I believe
  the Canadian government uses PCI software for some of its work in these
  areas.

SPAM (Spectral Analysis Manager)
--------------------------------
  Back in 1985 JPL developed something called SPAM (Spectral Analysis
  Manager) which got a fair amount of use at the time.  That was designed
  for Airborne Imaging Spectrometer imagery (byte data, <= 256 pixels
  across by <= 512 lines by <= 256 bands); a modified version has since
  been developed for AVIRIS (Airborne VIsual and InfraRed Imaging
  Spectrometer) which uses much larger images.

  Spam does none of these things (rectification, classification, PC and
  IHS transformations, filtering, contrast enhancement, overlays).
  Actually, it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement
  (stretching).  Spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering.

  The original Spam uses X or SunView to display.  The AVIRIS version may
  require VICAR, an executive based on TAE, and may also require a frame
  buffer.  I can refer you to people if you're interested.  PCW requires X
  for display.

  CLRview is a 3-dimensional visualization program designed to exploit
  the real-time capabilities of Silicon Graphics IRIS computers.

  This program is designed to provide a core set of tools to aid in the
  visualization of information from CAD and GIS sources.  It supports
  the integration of many common but disperate data sources such as DXF,
  TIN, DEM, Lattices, and Arc/Info Coverages among others.

  CLRview can be obtained from explorer.dgp.utoronto.ca (128.100.1.129)

Hmmm.  You need to spend some time in a library, son.

When the Bill of Rights was written, in addition to the (muzzleloading)
shotgun and pistol you mention we had:

 - rifles in calibers ranging from around .30 to .69 caliber and up.
 - cannon with various different projectiles to choose from (and owned
   by civilians).
 - breech-loading rifles

In addition, semiautomatic and full-automatic firearms had been patented
and/or demonstrated by several people in various places during the preceding
century or so.

Sounds good.  Any refererences to this actually happening, or is it
just exaggeration for effect following one or more incidents of someone
firing a handful of shots from something that may or may not be an
Uzi, semi- or full-auto?

>Just because someting was good once, does not mean it will be forever.

Until the root conditions that justified it go away (criminal behavior,
either private or government, which should be defended against), there's
no reason it should go away.

Grass Roots Motorsport [3/93] has a long article about MG/B's this month.
As far as collectivity/speculation is concerned they think it is a 
waste of time, especially the later rubber bumpered models are the least
desirable, a 1962 original model the most. The reasons for its low
value are easy availability and the fact that it just was not a very good
car.

I noticed that too.  Special agent (asshole actually) Ricks stated that
David Koresh had ""explosives that could blow up an armored vehicle 40
feet into the air.""  It looked like to me that the BDs had plenty of
opportunity to use these explosives---provided that they had them in the
first place.  For example, when one of the tanks was injecting CS gas
into the ranch house (yes ranch house; the BDs weren't living in a
fortress) they could have easily destroyed or disabled that tank because
it was idling there for a considerable length of time.  So, why didn't
they do this?  Could it be that they didn't have any explosives or
similar munitions?  I just don't buy what the ATF and FBI have been
saying.  Hopefully, the truth will come out.

Here's something noteworthy:  after the fire had been burning for some
time an explosion occurred---just *one* explosion.  The media said that
this was some of the explosives that the BDs posessed going off.  I
don't think this was the case.  My brother and I noticed that this
so-called ""explosion"" resembled a plume of propane gas being ignited.
We figure that this is what it was because of how the ""explosion""
looked and sounded.  Obviously, it wasn't due to something like TNT,
dynamite, or C4.  I have seen a propane explosion before...the explosion
in the ranch house greatly resembled this.  Also, I noticed something
that looked like a propane tank in the charred ruble the next day.

Isn't it curious that the ATF wasn't very forthcoming about how the four
officers got killed?  Many weeks had gone by before they stated that
some of the officers had been killed and/or wounded by grenades thrown
by the BDs.  Earlier, when someone asked one of the spokespersons about
whether or not an autopsy had been performed on the slain agents, they
said that an autopsy had been done but THEY WEREN'T READY TO RELEASE
THE FINDINGS.  Now why is this?  Does the ATF have something to hide?
Perhaps those four agents were killed by friendly fire.  What is the
cause of death exactly?  NO ONE HAS EVER SAID WHAT IT IS.

What is certain is this:  ATF agents *did* throw grenades into the
compound.  As a matter of fact, Mr. Koresh handed his lawyer a grenade
body during one of the lawyer's visits to the compound.  Later on
the lawyer gave the grenade body (I don't know if it was a dud or a
spent one btw) to the ATF.  How much do you want to bet that this
grenade will mysteriously disappear?  At this point in time the only
people we know who had grenades was the ATF agents.  Wouldn't it be
a shocker if the no one ever found any evidence of grenades, rockets,
or explosives in the rubble?  The ATF would sure have egg on their
face then.  Note that the ATF is doing the *initial* sweep of the
rubble.  The FBI and the Texas Rangers won't investigate until the
ATF is done.  This looks like a perfect opportunity for the ATF to
make sure that others ""find"" what they want for them to ""find"" if
you know what I mean.  I'm probably being a little paranoid here
but if I am I have could reason to be.  Recall that several weeks
had gone by before anyone said that the BDs had used grenades.
Also recall that early on the ATF had *denied* that their agents
used grenades on the BDs.  Someone is lying here.

This all would also implicate that in order for the sinning 2 month

Well, apparently we have another son of Dro 'the Butcher' to contend with. 
You should indeed be happy to know that you rekindled a huge discussion on
distortions propagated by several of your contemporaries. If you feel 
that you can simply act as an Armenian governmental crony in this forum 
you will be sadly mistaken and duly embarrassed. This is not a lecture to 
another historical revisionist and a genocide apologist, but a fact.

I will dissect article-by-article, paragraph-by-paragraph, line-by-line, 
lie-by-lie, revision-by-revision, written by those on this net, who plan 
to 'prove' that the Armenian genocide of 2.5 million Turks and Kurds is 
nothing less than a classic un-redressed genocide. We are neither in 
x-Soviet Union, nor in some similar ultra-nationalist fascist dictatorship, 
that employs the dictates of Hitler to quell domestic unrest. Also, feel 
free to distribute all responses to your nearest ASALA/SDPA/ARF terrorists,
the Armenian pseudo-scholars, or to those affiliated with the Armenian
criminal organizations.

x-Soviet Armenian government got away with the genocide of 2.5 million 
Turkish men, women and children and is enjoying the fruits of that genocide. 
You, and those like you, will not get away with the genocide's cover-up.

During the First World War and the ensuing years - 1914-1920, 
the Armenians through a premeditated and systematic genocide, 
tried to complete its centuries-old policy of annihilation against 
the Turks and Kurds by savagely murdering 2.5 million Muslims and 
deporting the rest from their 1,000 year homeland.

The attempt at genocide is justly regarded as the first instance
of Genocide in the 20th Century acted upon an entire people.

You could paint the skull mat white, then do some complicated

This thread si starting to get really silly. Such nonsense do not
belong in s.r.c and it really hurts me to read some of the posts on
this issue.

We chose to believe whetever we want, but we are not allowed to define
our own Christianity. we see in parts. If you see something that I do
not see, or vice versa, it does not give me the right to play jokes on
your belief!

There is no wonder that your ""miracle"" does not work. You designet it
yourself, and even if you were able to collect a group of people like
the one you describe, I see no reason why your ""miracle"" should really
happen. God is the one who does miracles, not humans!

After all we are all on the same way, or at least, we are all headed
for the same goal, following different paths. Remember that we are
going to spend eternity together. If I can not stand your view here on
earth, how can I possibly stand spending eternity together with you?

Tongues is a question of belief. Not wether you believe in Jesus, but
if you believe that He is able to give you this gift. Just as any
other of the gifts mentioned in the Bible. But there is no evidence in
the Bible that people who do not accept these gifts are in any way
better than others.

Maybe some of the people who have received spiritual gifts are more
interested in glorifying themselves than glorifying God, I don't know.
But if this is the case, it still does not suggest that the gifts are
faked.

In the Bible you will find that Jesus did not always do miracles. He
said that ""I do nothing, except what my father tells me."" Perhaps it
woulkd be for the best of all if we where all able to live by that
example!

In Him,
Bjorn

If you're going to go to those extremes, I guess you'd better start

My telephone line seems pretty stable and I have the Supra as well.  Works 
great but with every passing day I fall behind on how many great 14.4s are 
out.  Zoom is out of the question from what I'm hearing.  AT&T has a great 
product from what I hear and the Sportster is really cheap now too.

If you want to receive a fax, your computer will have to be on, but not 
the monitor and of course the modem.  You can set the number of rings that 
will receive the fax on a specific ring you set with Fax STF software.  
It's entirely up to you how to arrange that.  I've had faxes sent to me 
which is great but I've been home to set it.  I don't have a need to set 
fax receiving up all day.  Also I hear there is a device that can channel 
all incoming phone signals for about $70.  Rumor also that the phone 
company can hook you up with the same gizmo for about $5 if that's what 
you need.

Best of luck and write back if you'd like more feedback.

That's was the original answer. While it does not say that he has the head

 Currently there are no ""Velcro"" jump boots as issue in
the military, there are two other kinds. One is made my
Cochran and sell for $85.00 in either the Clothing sales
store or US Cavalry (Price match at the Cav store) the
second co is also sold but somewhat cheaper in design.
Actually they don't care what you wear as long is they
are 10 eyelets high.
There is another boot called a ""Tankers boot"" this has
similar construction to a wellington boot except for the
boot shape and has straps that wrap around for tightness.
Nice boots

>I think most of us would rather be held up with a knife than with a gun,
>but HOW THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO MANAGE THAT?  You still haven't offered

I've been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now, (even
contributed a few comments) but this stuff ""I'd rather face a knife than
a gun"" has GOT to come from ignorance!  I used to think pretty much the
same thing, then I got 'educated.'

People do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be, or how
quickly you can be killed with one.  Most people don't understand that
it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick
(within a minute or so) death.

The death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage
points of each other.  Many people not realizing how deadly knives are
'try their luck' and thus more get injured by knives.  A gun is deadly
only in a single direction and it's only advantage is that it is a
remote control weapon.  A contact weapon such as a knife controls a
spherical area 7 to 10 feet in diameter.

Most people have never seen knife wounds, aside from slicing a finger by
accident.  From 21 feet or so, a knife is very nearly an even match for
a holstered gun in experienced hands, even if the knife wielder has only
moderate skill.  From inside 10 feet or so, a knife is a match for a
DRAWN gun.  A knife is utterly silent, it never jams and never runs out
of ammunition.  It is limited only by the speed, dexterity skill and
ability of it's wielder.  Criminals in general are young, fast and
strong.  It's interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks
used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled
slashing attacks of novices.  I've talked to several well trained
martial artists.  They have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up
against a knife they simply plan on being cut, hopefully not as bad as
the attacker.

Practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment.  Practicing
with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a
knife, say a popsicle stick or tooth brush.  Criminals practice their
knife attacks in prison.

If you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize
these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is
the knife ripping through your throat, or in the case of an experienced
attacker, parts of your body falling off onto the ground.  A 60 year old
man with arthritis can close that 7 yard distance and gut you in about
one and a half seconds.  Dennis Tueller with a broken leg in a walking
cast managed it in two.  I've seen people close that distance and strike
in 1 second.  I'm old, over weight and slow.  I can do it in 1.3
seconds.  I've seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons
that you would not believe.  (How about a single stab wound to the chest
with a TABLE FORK!  In this case the attacker used the HANDLE, not the
pointed end.)

Add to this the 'fact' that hand gun 'stopping' power is largely a myth.
Except in the case of a central nervous system shot, or a round that
destroys the skeletal structure, it takes anywhere from 3 to twelve
seconds for a bullet wound to 'take effect.'

This is true of even heart shots.  There is the case of the police woman
in L.A., the first recorded survivor of a .357 shot to the heart.  That
lady not only killed her attacker, but chased him down to do it!  All
four of her shots, fired after SHE had been shot, struck the perp.  Atta
girl!  The bullet entered her on a downward angle, went through the apex
of her heart, down through the diaphragm, clipped her liver and
destroyed her spleen.  It then exited her back leaving a tennis ball
sized hole.  She died about six times on the operating table, but was
out of the hospital in 15 days and was back on full duty in eight
months!  She was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest.  She was
on her way home so happened to have her gun.  No, she doesn't think
civilians should have the same rights.  Sigh.

The moral of the story is that even if you DO manage to shoot a knife
attacker, you'd better be planning on doing some dodging.  A good
alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis.  People can often walk
(a little) on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor
them.  Many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against contact
weapons.  The target is as large as the traditional 'center of mass' and
is more reliable to STOP somebody with a contact weapon, assuming a
caliber powerful enough to 'do the job.'  Hot .38's on up will usually
do this.

Remember folks, the idea isn't to 'take em with you' but for you to live
and them to fail, whatever the consequences for them.  This the reason
'killing them' isn't our goal, or in many cases even good enough to keep
us alive.

I don't want to face a violent attack of any sort.  Knowing what I now
know, I can't rightly say I'd rather face a knife than an gun.  It would
have to depend on the attacker, and if I could pick and choose, I
WOULDN'T BE THERE.  This is really the bottom line.  Criminals do not
fear the law.  Criminals do not fear the weapon.  They fear the citizen
behind the weapon that has shown the resolution and determination to do
whatever it takes.

Rick.

I posted this to sci.psychology on April 3, and after seeing
your post here on panice disorder thought it would be
relevant.

-----

My research indicates that two schools of thought exist.
the literature promoting medication says it's the superior
treatment.  Not surprisingly, literature promoting cognitive
therapy also claims to be superior.

What are the facts?  Early in my research I didn't have a
bias towards either medication or cognitive therapy.  I
was interested in a treatment that worked.  After reading
journals published after 1986, the cognitive therapy camp
claims a higher success rate (approx 80%), a lower drop-out
rate, and no side effects associated with medication.

Lars-Goran Ost published an excellent article titled
""Applied Relaxation: Description of a coping technique and
a review of controlled studies.""  This is from Behav. Res. Ther.,
vol. 25, no. 5, pp. 397-409, 1987.  The article provides
instructions on how to perform applied relaxation (AR).
Briefly, you start with two 15 minute sessions daily, and
progress in 8-12 weeks to performing 10-15 thirty second sessions
daily.

I'll snail mail this article to anyone interested (USA only please;
International please pay for postage).

The real question here in my opinion is what Motorola processors running system
7 on a MAC are comparable to what Intel processors running Windows on a PC?  I
recall there being a conversation here that a 486/25 running Windows benchmarks
at about the same speed as 25Mhz 030 in system 7.  I don't know if that is
true, but I would love to hear if anyone has any technical data on this.

Wait a minute.  I agree with you that people have to take responsibility
for their own behavior (I assume that's what you meant by the word
""account""), but also for ""the behavior of their immediate community""?

First of all, how ""immediate"" are you talking about, and secondly, I
have a lot of trouble with any theory of social behavior or justice
which charges anyone with the duty of taking responsibility for or
accounting for the actions of a different person...

What does a lack of taste of foods, or a sense of taste that seems ""off""
when eating foods in someone who has cancer mean? What are the possible
causes of this? Why does it happen?

Pt has Stage II breast cancer, and is taking tamoxifin. Also has Stage IV
lung cancer with known CNA metastasis, and is taking klonopin (also had
cranial radiation treatments).

Hello fellow 'netters.

I am asking for your collected wisdom to help me decide which printer I
should purchase, the Canon BJ200 (BubbleJet) vs. the HP DeskJet 500.  I
thought, rather than trust the salesperson, I would benefit more from
relying on those who use these printers daily and use them to their fullest
potential.  And, I figure all of you will know their benefits and pitfalls
better than any salesperson.

Now, I would greatly appreciate any information you could render on the 360
dpi of the Canon BubbleJet vs. the Hewlett-Packard DeskJet 500 (300 dpi).
Which is faster?  Is there a noticeable print quality difference,
particularly in graphics?  Which will handle large documents better (75
pages or more) -- any personal experience on either will be appreciated
here?  Which works better under Windows 3.1 (any driver problems, etc)?
Cost of memory, font packages, toner cartridges, etc?  Basically, your
personal experiences with either of these machines is highly desirable,
both good and bad.

Advance kudos and thanks for all your input.  E-mail or news posting is
readily acceptable, but e-mail is encouraged (limits bandwidth).

That you don't recognize the Biblical commentary used.  Those in the

You missed the point -- which is that the Prophets, the Psalms, and 
Revelation, all together, provide a very rich view of a very special
event -- a wedding.

How are you able to make such a conclusion?  Please note, that the
first part of Revelation makes it clear that the address is to those
in the church. That said, it doesn't hurt to try to see what the 
prophecies are ahead of time -- for those outside the church.

So you say. It should be interesting to see what the investigators

Very glad you asked, since I goofed -- it should be Philippian 1:14-19: 
(here from NIV)

	Because of my chains, most of the brothers in the Lord
	have been encouraged to speak the word of God more
	courageously and fearlessly.

	It is true that some preach Christ out of envy and 
	rivalry, but others out of good will. The latter do so
	in love, knowing that I am put here for the gospel. 
	The former preach Christ out of selfish ambition, not
	sincerely, supposing that they can stir up trouble for
	me while I am chains. But what does it matter? 

	The important thing is that in every way, whether from
	false motives or true, Christ is preached. And because
	of this I rejoice.
	
My comment stems from the realization that we who love the Lord, are
human and imperfect. Whatever we ""preach,"" no matter how eloquent, or
how corrupted -- is of little difference. Those who know the Master's
voice will recognize Him -- a gem-stone amidst rock. Such is also the 
lesson of the ""stumblingblock."" For those who have an ear to hear.

Well, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does
everyone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded
spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters
than lefthanded batters.  I just don't understand why people insist
on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium).
Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have
the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters.
I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams
may be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probably
only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters
for this reason during the regular season.

I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of
whether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have
higher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managers
go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of
the platoon advantage).

Am I missing something here?

 No. I do not thing we are doing them a favor.  I have simply stated that
 they are not treated as a second class citizens. That was my point.
 I fail to see how my words show discrimination. And what do you mean that
 they do not get nothing? Is, for example, helth insurance, food, and tuition
 nothing?

 I'm sorry, but I cannot see any logical order in the above argument.

 What part exactly is this one? The people cannot even sell their property
 if they want to leave Turkey.  The patriarch could not get a permision to
 renovate some buildings for decades; it needed a special agreement between
 the two goverments for this. Talk about a part of the society? Why has the
 size of the Greek community reduced to 1,500 old people and priests then?

About 18 months ago, I heard a report on NPR about a 900-number
""1-900-STO-PPER"" or some such, for placing untraceable calls.
You call them, and on ""bong"" tone dial the number you want to
call; they told the NPR interviewer that nothing short of a
court order (which they'd fight) would make them release their
records.

Basically, any prophet I've ever dealt with has either been busy 
hawking stolen merchandise or selling swampland house lots in 
Florida.  Then you hear all the stories of sexual abuse by prophets
and how the families of victims were paid to keep quiet about it.

Never mind that, but let me tell you about this Chevelle I bought 
from this dude (you guessed it, a prophet) named Mohammed.  I've
got the car for like two days when the tranny kicks, then Manny, 
my mechanic, tells me it was loaded with sawdust!  Take a guess
whether ""Mohammed"" was anywhere to be found.  I don't think so.

This is just not so - many of the earliest cars had their steering
controls in the center of the vehicle, and there is no discernible
pattern of left- or right-hand steering controls until a few years into
the 20th century, when, in America at least, left-hand wheels became the
pattern. The mule team (or horses, I imagine) explanation, however,
seems to have some merit.

Is their a pd/freeware hard drive utility that can handle
a compressed IDE drive without screwwing it up?

Need to document occasional failures in reading/writing,
check overall integrity of disk's hardware and sectors.

I believe that all of my problems with DOS/Windows can
be isolated to my drive.  Getting occasional corrupted
files, even with smartdrive, 32 bit access turned off.
Had these problems under DOS 5.  Only with drive C.
Drive D may have had one failure, but that file was
under the control of Win/Winword on drive C.

All utilities available to me report no problems.
DOS, NDD (NU4.5).  Another symptom, SD took forever
on C, and kicked me out with a suspension till NDD run
6 to 8 times.

Thanks.

No, the sky does not, at this time, belong to anyone.  Ownership is necessary
to the definition because someone has to have the authority to decide if the
action was good or bad.  If neither you or I own a brick wall, then I can't
unilaterally declare that spraypainting my name on it is right, and you don't
have the authority to declare that it is wrong.  The owner may find it artistic
or she may be call the police.

(this applies to the argument on bright satellites more than street lights)

It's vandalism because many people -- power companies -- do maliciously waste light. 

""maliciously"" implies evil intent.  The lighting companies aren't going out
of their way to spoil the sky.  They just don't care.

>If they can sell you

It is the responsibility of the customer to choose the most efficient hardware.
If that's what your city will buy, that's what the lighting company will sell.
Write a letter to city hall.

Please note that I'm not defending light pollution.  The orignial focus of 
this thread was space based light sources.

Wrong, wrong, completely wrong (and a little misleading, too).

White noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a
constant bandwidth. That is, a 5 Hz wide band at 20 Hz will have precisely
the same amount of energy as a 5 Hz band at 20 kHz.

Pink noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a constant
precentage bandwidth. Thus, a 5% wide band of noise at 20 Hz (whose
bandwidth is 1 Hz) will contain the same energy as a 5% wide band at 20
kHz (whose bandwidth is 1000 Hz wide). 

White noise is often used with spectrum analyzers that have constant
bandwidths, pink noise is used with audio-type real-time analyzers whose
bandwidths are centert-frequency dependent (often described as ""1/3
octave"" or ""1/2 octave"" or some such terminology).

White noise, relative to pink noise, has more energy at high frequencies
(at a rate equal to 3 dB per octave). Pink noise, relative to white noise,
has more energy at low frequencies (at a rate equl to, again, 3
db/octave).

I have the same problem.  I have looked at Motif++, WWL, InterViews, GINA++,
and a few variations on the above.  I've also done a cursory examination
of Rogue Wave's View.h++.  I like View.h++'s abstractions best of all of the
toolkits I mentioned, but the resulting code looks little like Motif, and I
have little confidence that this software will catch on or otherwise result
in significant longevity for my code.  GINA++ allows you to write code which
looks a great deal like Motif and also makes interesting use of inheritance,
but the resulting code is almost too Motif-like, and is certainly not
significantly less verbose than equivalent C code.  InterViews looks
promising, but I haven't found a free version with Motif support, and I'm
not confident how widely InterViews with Motif support will be adopted,
and what (if any) specific Motif support will be available over time.  The
other libraries produce code which is less Motif-like, but which does not make
sufficient use of the features of C++ to simplify my coding task.

At this point, my inclination is to write my Motif manipulation routines in
C, and invoke those routines from my C++ code using simple abstractions suited
to my specific task.  Later, if OSF or some credible standards-setting body
comes up with a C++ interface to Motif, I will change to that.  It does me
no goo to write in C++ if my choice of interfaces leaves me with code which
leaves me tied to an abstraction which is not consistent with the industry
directions.  It's better to take a standard if inferior solution for now
than to go with a slgihtly superior approach which will leave me with both
useless code and useless skills a few years from now.  Views.h++ is the only
library I'd consider right now, but in our environment, we'd end up spending
nearly $5000 to use it, and I can't justify it when it's likely to cause
short-term productivity decreases as we learn the new abstraction, and is
unlikely to be a sufficiently long-lived solution for us to reap the benefits
at the high end of the J curve.

I found this little gem, I don't know if anyone has any interest/comments...


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hi everyone,
           I'm a commited Christian that is battling with a problem.  I know
that romans talks about how we are saved by our faith not our deeds, yet
hebrews and james say that faith without deeds is useless, saying' You fools,
do you still think that just believing is enough?'

Now if someone is fully believing but there life is totally lead by themselves
and not by God, according to Romans that person is still saved by there faith.
But then there is the bit which says that God preferes someone who is cold to
him (i.e. doesn't know him - condemned) so a lukewarm Christian someone who
knows and believes in God but doesn't make any attempt to live by the bible.

Now I am of the opinion that you a saved through faith alone (not what you do)
as taught in Romans, but how can I square up in my mind the teachings of James
in conjunction with the lukewarm Christian being 'spat-out'

Can anyone help me, this really bothers me.-- 

in Christ,

Will

I've got 2 sets of sample cd's for sale

set one (2cd's)-geared towards house/techno/pop and rap

The 1st cd is all drum loops and drum sounds over 1500 of them
The second contains analog synths, basses, bass loops,  wavestations, vox
loops and much much more. 

The second set-

A variety of different sounds from new age to rock etc... kind of a
sampler cd..(pardon the pun)

Both have never been used and I can supply a list of categories for the
sounds if someone is seriously interested.

I'd like 130 for all three as they were $200ish new...

Subject: Xmas light set with 2 levels of brightness

Another version of a variable brightness Xmas light set:
This set starts with a 2 blinker 35 bulb string.  

DIAGRAM:  orginal 2 way set

120v---+--b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!
       !---b-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!
                           !
120rtn_____________________!

modified set for 2 level brightness:

                string 1
120v---------*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*--!
  \_10K_______*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-!
    5w    !      string 2     !
          b   ________________!
120v rtn__!___!

             ^ Note: no mods to wiring to the right of this point.

Only one blinker is used.

Note that the blinker would not have as much current thru it as the
string 1 bulbs, because of the second string of bulbs in
parallel with it.  That's why the use of the 10K 5W resistor
here to add extra current thru the blinker to make up for the
current shunted thru the second string while the blinker is glowing
and the second string is not glowing.  When the blinker goes open,
this resistor has only a slight effect on the brightness of the
strings, s1 slightly dimmer, s2 slightly brighter.  
Or use a 3W 120v bulb in place of the 10K resistor if you can get
one.  Caution, do not replace with a standard C9 bulb, as these
draw too much current and burn out the blinker.  C9 = approx 7W.

What you'll see when it's working:  powerup, string 1 will light 
at full brightness, and b will be lit, bypassing most of the current 
from the second string, making them not light.  b will open, placing 
both strings in series, making the string that was out to glow at a 
low brightness, and the other string that was on before to glow 
at reduced brightness. 

Be sure to wire and insulate the splices, resistor leads, and cut wires 
in a safe manner!

The most common form of condescending is the rational versus irrational
attitude.  Once one has accepted the _assumption_ that there is no god(s),
and then consider other faiths to be irrational simply because their
assumption(s) contradict your assumption, then I would say there's a
lack of consistency here.

Now I know you'll get on me about faith.  If the _positive_ belief that God
does not exist were a closed, logical argument, why do so many rational
people have problems with that ""logic""?

But you, probably like me, seem to be a soft atheist.  Sorry for the flamage.

It might have appeared to attack atheism in general, but its point was
that mass killing happens for all sorts of reasons.  People will hate who
they will and will wave whatever flag to justify it, be it cross or
hammer&sickle.  The Stalin example _is_ important not only because it's
still a widely unappreciated era that people want to forget but also
because people really did love him and his ideas, even after all that he
had wrought.

First, all the pink crows/unicorns/elves arguments in the world will not
sway most people, for they simply do not accept the analogy.  Why?

One of the big reasons is that many, many people want something
beyond this life.  You can pretend that they don't want this, but I for
one can accept it and even want it myself sometimes.

And there is nothing unique in this example of why people want a God.
Can love as a truth be proven, logically?

John the Baptist boasted of Jesus to many people.  I find it hard to see
how that behavior is arrogant at all.  Many Christians I know also boast
in this way, but I still do not necessarily see it as arrogance.  Of course,
I do know arrogant Christians, doctors, and teachers as well.  Technically,
you might consider the person who originally made a given claim to be arrogant,
Jesus, for instance.

I speak against strong atheism.  I also often find that the evidence
supporting a faith is very subjective, just as, say, the evidence supporting
love as truth is subjective.

just picked out this one point because it struck me....
why do you believe this?  muslims believe in many of the same things
that christians and jews believe; they believe jesus, while not the
messiah, is a prophet.  this seems to me to be much closer to
christianity than other religions are.  (then again i tend to be
somewhat liberal about others' beliefs.)

this also relates to the serbian ""ethnic cleansing"" question.  i have
been waiting for condemnations of this and have seen very few.  HOW
can we stand by and watch innocent people, even people whose beliefs
we condemn, if this is the case (and don't get me wrong, the things
fundamenalist muslims have to say about women make my blood boil), be
tortured, raped (the stories about that made me physically ill), and
killed?  jesus loves all, not just those who love him back -- and he
would advocate kindness toward them (in the hopes of converting them,
if that's the way you want to put it) rather than killing them.  

i'm sorry i got off the subject here -- maybe i should have used a
different title.  i did need to get this off my chest, however.

peace (shalom),

[I am also worried about this issue.  I've made a posting under my own
name earlier today.  I do not much want to discuss Moslem beliefs
here.  This isn't the right group for it.  Their beliefs about Jesus
appear to come as much from the Koran as the Bible.  This means that
while they honor him, what they think he did and stood for differs in
many ways from Christian beliefs about him.  But Moslem beliefs are
an appropriate topic for soc.religion.islam.

As I'm sure you know, many Christians believe that you must accept
Christ in order to be saved.  While Stanley's comment appears to be
anti-Moslem, I would assume he would say the same thing about all
religions other than Christianity.

So after I've flashed my lights at the chap in front and he doesn't
'pass it on' (and few if any do), what next? On major highways, 3 or more
lanes in each direction, keeping to the extreme right blocks folks who
are entering. Also, as someone posted in this thread, here in the D.C.
area we have a few left lane exits (sounds like 66). If you wait until
the last minute to get in the left lane you won't, cause these yoyos
won't make room.

We have a particularly bad strech here in Merryland just over the Cabin
John bridge. There are two very long entry ramps which all the hurry-up
yahoos dive into cause they want to get ahead. When we get to the point
where these ramps merge, all hell breaks lose. The result is that traffic
which was moving at 55 on the VA side of the bridge, stalls on t'other
side. If these dingbats had stayed in lane, allowed the folks coming up
the two ramps to merge, we would still be doing 55. Instead we do start-
stop for 4 miles. Dave Barry's idea of a laser equipped car would be
real useful here.

Bob

PS: If you drive the beltway and want to merge, look for a brown Probe
with a silver haired driver, then use your signals - I don't read minds,
but I do try to be courteous. They told me courtesy was contagious, but
I guess the folks around here have had their shots :-/

It sorta depends on what you drive. I remember running a two channel 
Motorola with a vibrator power supply and about 40 tubes in a 1958 
Volkwagen. The poor little 6 V generator had a heck of a time, and if you 
keyed the mic at night, you needed to be stationary, because your lights 
got AWFUL DIM. Isn't progress wonderful?

Dear Senator/Congressman/President {fill in the blank}

I am writing you to voice my strong opposition to President Clinton's Clipper 
Chip initiative. This proposal to establish a secret government designed
cryptography chip with government key registration as the standard for voice
encryption is very disturbing. The idea that citizens must register their 
secrets with the government just in case they are trying to keep them secret 
is patently unAmerican. Additionally, the press release for this program
strongly implied that other forms of cryptography would be banned after the 
Clipper Chip standard is in place. This latest attack on our civil rights is 
deeply disturbing and is frankly a voting issue for me. 

The presidents press release stated that the plan strikes a balance between the
legitimate needs of law enforcement and a citizens right to privacy but this 
is not the case. The fact is that since other strong cryptographic equipment 
is avalible the criminals, drug dealers and terrorists mentioned in the press 
release will simply use non clipper cryptography. Meanwhile the average citizen
may gain no protection against warentless wiretaps by the government since the 
government escrowed key is derived deterministicly from the unit serial number
which is broadcast by the chip durring its opperation. This seems like an 
obvious back door for the NSA and law enforcement. If you still do nott 
understand my objection to key registration, consider the way J. Edgar Hoover 
blackmailed government officials like yourself; would you now use a phone to 
transmit personal details of your life that the NSA and FBI have the keys to?

How different would the contamination threat of a small manuevering tug

I know that no small manuevering tug exists,  but maybe  one could
soup up a Bus 1.   Does anyone out there have the de-clasified
specs on hte BUS 1?  would it be able to provide enough  control
force to balance the HST,  and  still have the rocket thrust
to hurl her into a decent high orbit?

The problem is no-one seems to have the exact numbers.  When the mission
was planned originally at 3 spacewalks,  and 3 astronauts,  there was
enormous concern over the mass margins for the flight.  THey
have now planned for 5 EVA's,  an 11 day mission and have 2 reserve
EVA's and an emergency EVA.  Obviously that is coming from somewhere.
My guess is the OMS burn  fuel,  or  re-boost  margin.   

I just figured, if GOldin wants to really,  prove out faster, cheaper
better,   have some of the whiz kids  slap together an expendable
space manuevering tug  out of a BUs1,  and use that for the re-boost.
it has to be better then using the Discovery as a tow truck.

I answer in the affirmative.  Now this answer might sound a little
intellectually dishonest to Bob, but I think I have been accused before

Now I have a question for Bob.  Why in the world would any self-respecting

difficult enough time keeping up with it, and I think I know something
about the subject.     

Bob reminds me of my roommate.  In order to disbelieve atheism, he says 
he will need to be proven wrong about it.  Well, I don't even waste 
my time trying.  I tell him that he'll just have to take my word for it. 
In response, he tells me he will say an ""atheist's prayer"" for me. 

Good luck, Bob.  And, best regards.

I found the personal attacks on Prof. Denning pretty disgusting.
I don't agree with all her positions; but I think scholars can
disagree without the argument getting into the gutter.

If these personal attacks are what stopped Prof. Denning from
replying on issues of substance, they have cause real harm
to the serious debate here.

She hasn't.  Dorothy Denning has spent many years earning the
professional respect of her colleagues, and something won in this
manner is not easily lost.  Her support of the clipper -- no matter
how unpopular that position may be -- serves far more to enhance the
clipper's respectability than to diminish her own.

I am 35 and am recovering from a case of Chicken Pox which I contracted
from my 5 year old daughter.  I have quite a few of these little puppies
all over my bod.  At what point am I no longer infectious?  My physician's
office says when they are all scabbed over.  Is this true?

Is there any medications which can promote healing of the pox?  Speed up
healing?  Please e-mail replies, and thanks in advance.

To go one step further, you could write Roland Slabon, Pres. of the

to send your $12 bucks if ya want to join. As far as the price of '60's
Beemers, it varies wildly, from a low of around $1000 for an unrestored
bike that still runs (like an R50 or R60) to $4500 or so for a restored
R69S.  Don't listen to that bull about the old bmw's not being ""good

You macinators who have used these voice messaging/FAX/data-modems.  I
have a question.  First what brand names do you recommend(I am mostly
interested in the voice messaging and FAX part).  Is the voice part as
reliable and understandable as the sellers claim?  Approximately, how
much hard drive space does an average day of callers take up, if they
speak for one minute?  
Any feed back would be appreciated.  My company is looking at buying
one or two.  Hey, I may buy one myself too.

Thanks in advance

   a. the client was invoked with a -display argument
      or

That people are at risk and that some die during a hostage situation might
be considered an acceptable scenario in storming a compound. 

When EVERYONE dies (save for nine people), including twenty children, the 
outcome must be considered a failure.

Now was the failure due to unforseeable circumstances, incompetence, or
negligence?  From the double talk and multiple stories I've seen on the news
coming from the FBI and Reno I find ""it was an honest mistake"" hard to swallow

Let's hope they get their stories straight for the second round of questions.

Can someone point me in the direction of any papers (not necessarily
formally conducted studies) discussing how much traffic X apps generate
for the network, particularly in comparison with curses-bases apps 
over telnet?  Also, does an X server typically buffer up user keyboard
input a line at a time?  Can the X client control this, asking for
keystrokes immediately?  Thanks in advance for any feedback!

Ah, but the illusion in football is that there is always lots of action and
a sense of urgency because of the game clock (not all the time, but it happens
when there's less than 5 minutes to go quite often).  This sense creates
drama, even when there may not necessarily be any and that holds a viewer's
attention.  In baseball, only 3 players are involved in the action for about
(here comes a wild guess) 70% of the time?  And they're just playing a
sophisticated game of catch/hold-the-ball/step-out-of-the-box/adjust-chains/
touch-self-in-interesting-locations.  There's a lot of ""dead time"" with the
players warming up between innings or the manager visiting the pitcher at the
mound or the manager removing the pitcher and bringing in a relief pitcher
who then takes (8? 10?) pitches or Helen Dell playing the organ (Dodger fans
will appreciate that one).  To the non baseball junkie this is boring.
At any rate, I'm not putting baseball down for this - I've been an avid
fan since I can remember - it's just that watching a baseball game on
T.V. at home can be tedious for the non baseball junkie.  That's what Major
League Baseball and the networks are trying to address when they talk of
shortening the game.  It's because of T.V. not because ""football has more
action than baseball"".

	Again we have the trust in government problem here. Members of 
Mr. Sternlight's generation trust the government to a degree which
members of my generation find ridiculous. I would suggest that Mr. Sternlight
read about the COINTELPRO program, or about J. Edgar Hoover, or about
the wire-tapping of Martin Luther King, then, after he has digested this
information he can ponder the fact that while the government does not
tap every conversation that they have a record of tapping many conversations
that they have no right to, even under their own laws. Given the long
history of members of the US government ignoring the laws that apply
to them, it is no wonder that so many people in here sound so paranoid, and
given the fact that it is often difficult or impossible to punish these
individuals once they are discovered, it is no wonder that so many people
in here have so little faith in the escrow proposal for Clipper.

Why not use the PD C library for reading/writing TIFF files? It took me a

Just for the record, Egyptian troops were one of the first to be
stationed there. I can't remember the exact date but it was late last
year. In fact, they lost at least one man there as far as I know.

Putting aside our substantial differences, I'd like to ask the knowledgeable
ones to give feedback on this.  Let me explain.

One of my family members last week was discovered to have a brain tumor after
having some difficulties with walking and writing (she is 64 years old).
Otherwise, she is in fine health.  The discovery was made via CAT scans.

She then had MRI scans done, where small cancerous areas were discovered
in her lungs.  Biopsies showed it to be adenocarcinoma.  One spot is
in the lungs, and another in the pneumothorax.  The oncologists believe
the cancer started in the lungs and caused the brain tumor (she smoked
until four years ago).

Anyway, I'd like feedback as to what adenocarcinoma is, how it is different
from other cancers, how she will be treated (luckily the tumor is right
below the skull and can be easily removed), and statistically what are
the chances for full remission/recovery?

Thanks.

You can tell your friend from me that I was in a publisher's
warehouse one time and saw thousands of copies of The Joy of
Cooking and every one of them was syllable-perfect.

I have since sold all I own and become a follower of The Joy
of Cooking.  The incident I mentioned convinced me, once and
for all, that The Joy of Cooking is inspired by god and the
one true path to his glory.

Sigh.

The use of the term ZOG (which, I understand, stands for Zionist
Occupation Government, or some such bullshit) was used for satiric
purpose.  Since the posting I was responding to was on alt.conspiracy,
among other crossposted groups, I composed a satiric message
using jargon sometimes found on that group.  I figured that the
content (and context) of the message was so absurd that no one would
take any part of it completely seriously.

If anyone believes that I am an anti-semite, it will be news to my
Jewish boss and his Israeli wife, both of whom I am on cordial terms
with as well as as the many Jews that I have been friends, companions,
and co-workers with over the years.  Not to mention, news to me.

As far as guns go... I support the Bill of Rights -- all of it -- and
if you wish to arm yourself to the teeth, by all means, do so.
However, the concept of a .50 calibre machine gun as a sporting weapon
(for target practice or otherwise) struck, and continues to strike me
as moderately absurd, even if constitutionally protected.

To each their own.

I believe that the ""A-D converters"" found on a joystick port are really
timers that tick off how long it takes an R-C circuit (the R being your
paddle) to charge up to something like 1/2 Vcc.  For games this works
pretty well, but you certainly wouldn't want to try to take lab
measurements off something as non-linear as that.

Hmm... I suppose you could linearize it in software, but the real problem
is that the precision of your measurement is no longer constant (higher
voltages would be more precise).

On the other hand, I could be wrong and perhaps the game card designers
splurged for the extra $.50 to make a cheap constant current source out of
an op amp.  But I wouldn't expect that...

Flights of fancy, and other irrational approaches, are common.  The crucial
thing is not to sit around just having fantasies; they aren't of any use
unless they make you do some experiments.  I've known a lot of scientists
whose fantasies lead them on to creative work; usually they won't admit
out loud what the fantasy was, prior to the consumption of a few beers.

(Simple example: Warren Jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a DNA
electrophoresis gel of human ALU fragments.  He got very excited, hoping that
he'd seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic
genes.  This fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out
binding assays.  The result was a well-conserved, 400 or so bp, sequence
that occurs about 500,000 times in the human genome.  Unfortunately for
Warren's fantasy, it turns out to be a transposon that is present in
so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into
the genome.  On the other hand, the characteristics of transposons were
much elucidated; the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was
recognized; and the standard method of recognizing human DNA was created.
Other species have different sets of transposons.  Fortunately for me,
Warren and I used to eat dinner at T.G.I. Fridays all the time.)

I'm not sure that it's random.  But there is no known rational mechanism
for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses.  If you are really
working in an unknown area, it is unlikely that you will have much sense
of what might or might not be true; under those circumstances, the best
thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have.  If they are wrong,
you will find out soon enough; but at least, you will find out _something_.
If you try to do experiments at random, with no prior conceptions at all
in mind, you will probably get nowhere.

>(Though why this critical
>function should be less subject to the non-rational forces is a mystery.

Unfortunately, the critical function does sometimes become hostage to
non-rational forces.  Then we get varieties of pathological science:
Lysenko, Mirsky's opposition to DNA-as-gene, cold fusion, and so forth.

I don't agree that this follows.  In fact, this is _exactly_ the point at
which I disagree with Feyerabend.  It is a most important part of the
culture of science that one keeps one's jealousies out of the refereeing
process.  Failures there are aplenty, but, on the whole, things work out.

Another point: there are a couple of senses of the phrase ``experimental
design''.  I'd say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_,
not design.  Alexander Fleming (Proc. Royal Soc., 1922) chose to look for
bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons (Phage had previously
been found in locust diarrhea; Fleming probably thought runny bottom, runny
nose, what the hell, it's worth a try.) but his method of looking for phage
was well-designed to detect anything phage-like; in fact, he found lysozyme.

It is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs. irrational.  Perhaps
you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out
for perfectly rational reasons, or interesting new theories that were first
advanced from logical grounds.  The main examples I can think of are from
modern high-energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole.

	There is a free program called 'xkernel' which does just that.
It is by Seth Robertson (seth@ctr.columbia.edu).  It takes a sun 3 and
boots a limited kernel which allows you to run X.  We converted 4
machines over this semester and the speedup is enormously appreciable
-- I find them faster than an NCD 15inch black&white XTerminal that we
are playing with, and a bigger screen to boot!  As a matter of fact,
the department just bought some old sun3s at an auction to convert!

} Xkernel is available for anonymous ftp from ftp.ctr.columbia.edu
} [128.59.64.40] in /Xkernel/Xkernel.shar (/Xkernel is a symlink to the
} latest version of Xkernel)

	Note that the compiled version which is available is for the
sun 3/50, but compiling to work for a sun 3/1xx should be quite easy.

	I am not connected with xkernel except as a satisfied
installer and user 8).  I may be able to answer questions; feel free
to email me.

I dunno, on my old GS1000E the tank-seat junction was nice and smooth.
But if you were to travel all the way forward, you'd collect the top
triple-clamp in a sensitive area. I'd hate to have to make the choice,
but I think I'd prefer the FJ's gas tank. :-)

Hello,

I have a 386sx25 notebook with windows 3.1 running fine. WINWORD 2.0 and 
QUATTRO-PRO for windows also work fine when no virtual memory is used. 
Switching on the virtual memory option these programs (probably others too) 
don't work, the system crashes. The same programs work well with arbitrary 
virtual memory on two other desktop PC's. What am I doing wrong?

If you can help, please mail to me directly, if possible.

Thank you very much in advance.

	1.  Don't hold your finger on it
	2.  When cooking with it use a very small pan and be sure
	  to not spill liquids on the components
	3.  If you do not plan to cook with it there are a number of

 excellent question timothy. i hpoe the answers you get will be satisfactory  
as we can not understand the mind of god. but to attempt to answer you  
clearly. GOD of the Bible has given us humans relativly little about how he  
intends to judge mankind. the first test is those who have beleived that Jesus  
Christ is the Son of GOD and that his death and resurrection was sufficent to  
serve justice for all the acts we commit that are wrong in the eyes of god,  
the bible calls this sin. for those who die before the end of the world/have  
already died it is more complicated to explain without lapsing in to cliche.
  God must judge people on the baasis of their works in this world. however  
there is no plus and minus system for GOD. he has declared that he can not  
tolerate spiritual imperfection, thus he can only based your worthiness to  
live with him on the wrong in your life. 
  Good people, yes even Christians are going to constantly sin before GOD, The  
Christian hoever thanks GOD that Christ has given his life for his sin's  
penalty. the proscribed punishment for sin is death, just as the proscribed  
punishment for robbery is time in jail. God then cannot ask for anything but  
punishement for those sins. He does not want to condem. the Bible says in John  
3:17, that God did not send his son in to the word to condem it but that  
through him it might be saved."" when i realize that i have sinned, and i do  
with painful regularity, i must approach GOD and ask him to not hold thew sin  
against me, i have that right and privlige only because of Christ. as for Jews  
they are promised that they must believe on the Messiah who would come, and  
dis come in Jesus of Nazereth. Muslims, i fear have been given a lie from the  
fater of lies, Satan. They need Christ as do us all.
  for those who don't have that right, in the view of the bible they stand  
olone in their defense. are you going to hell? i can not answer that for you.  
i can only say that perhaps it is eaiser to ask and answer how can i not go to  
Hell? that step is much more rewarding.

stan toney stoney@oyster.smcm.edu
my opinions are my own, you may borrow them

p.s. stay in touch and keep asking questions not just to us but to God as  
well, he listens too.

If you happen to be running the new msdos 6, you could use multi-

I had this problem as well - It had to do with the CG6 graphics card that
comes with the IPX.  What fixed the problem for me was to apply the ""sunGX.uu""
that was part of Patch #7.  Patch #1 also used this file so perhaps you
didn't apply the one that came with Patch #7.

Are you confusing Bhagwan Rajneesh (sp?) with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi
here by any chance?  I think Bhagwan was in Oregon with all the Rolls
Royces.  Maharishi Mahesh Yogi founded Transcendental Meditation and
does the yogic flying stuff.  Bhagwan's group was a communal, free sex
kind of thing.  I think they both had beards, though.

	The fact is that Koresh and his followers involved themselves
	in a gun battle to control the Mt Carmel complex. That is not
	in dispute. From what I remember of the trial, the authories
	couldn't reasonably establish who fired first, the big reason

RTw  12/23 0859  GULF ARABS DEMAND IRAN WITHDRAWAL FROM ISLANDS 

 (Eds: updates with end of summit details, quotes) 
    By Youssef Azmeh 
    ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states, emerging from a summit
that restored 
their unity after almost three months of crisis, piled pressure on Iran
on Wednesday to 
reverse its virtual annexation of a strategic Gulf island. 
    They issued a statement after a three-day Gulf Cooperation Council
summit saying Iran 
had to show proof of its good neighbourly intentions by rescinding
measures that ""rocked 
Gulf stability and security."" 
    The leaders avoided the anti-Iranian rhetoric of recent statements
by Egypt, which 
engineered a last minute settlement of a border row between Saudi Arabia
and Qatar that 
allowed all members to attend the summit. 
    Egypt said its fears about Iranian intentions in the region and
Tehran's alleged 
encouragement of Moslem fundamentalist unrest were largely behind
President Hosni 
Mubarak's mediation. 
    The GCC statement stressed that developing relations between the
Gulf Arab states and 
Iran ""is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take
in line with its 
commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of
the sovreignty and 
territorial integrity of the region's states."" 
    It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it
shares with the 
United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the Greater and
Lesser Tumbs 
islands. 
    Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a
small garrison it 
established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah. 
    It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the
island for the 
UAE government. But diplomats say it continues to exercise its authority
over the whole 
island, which the UAE sess as as virtual annexation. 
    The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the
UAE has since the 
Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part
of a general 
settlement. 
    The GCC leaders called on the U.N. to maintain sanctions against
Iraq for not fully 
implementing Security Council resolutions following its 1990 invasion of
Kuwait. 
    They endorsed once again the ""Damascus Declaration,"" a pact signed
with Egypt and 
Syria after their troops took part in the U.S. led alliance that drove
Iraqi troops out of 
Kuwait. 
    But delegates said the leaders were unable to agree the details of a
fund they 
announced they would create at their last summit in Kuwait last year
which would have 
helped Egypt's and Syria's economic development programme. 
    They said the leaders could not agree on a breakdown of
contributions from each state 
although the total amount had been scaled down to $6 billion from the
$10 billion agreed 
last year. 
    The fact that the leaders of all GCC states -- Saudi Arabia,
Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman and 
Qatar -- attended the summit was seen as a major achievement although
their unity was only 
maintained with outside help. 
    Most delegations were not too worried for the moment about the slow
progress of the 
conservative rulers discussions on a future security structure for the
region that boasts 
the bulk of global oil and gas reserves. 
    The leaders were unable to choose between two proposals. 
    One put forward by a summit committee headed by Oman's Sultan Qaboos
to create a 
100,000-man rapid deployment force that could rush to defend any member
against external 
aggression, such as Iraq's invasion of Kuwait. 
    Another was a Saudi-supported plan to expand the existing 10,000-man
""Peninsula 
Shield"" force which had so far played a largely symbolic role and is
commanded by a Saudi 
general. 
    Little headway was made on plans for a reginal common market
although the summit 
called for concrete proposals to be submitted to next year's summit due
to be held in 
Saudi Arabia next December.

RTw  12/23 0835  GULF LEADERS END SUMMIT 

    ABU DHABI, Dec 23, Reuter - Gulf Arab states ended a three-day
annual summit on 
Wednesday with an appeal to Iran to end its occupation of three
strategic Gulf islands as 
a condition for restoring friendly ties across the Gulf. 
    A joint statement issued after the summit, marked by relief over the
settlement of a 
row between two Gulf Cooperation Council members, also called for
continued U.N. sanctions 
against Iraq. 
    It said Baghdad had failed to implement key Security Council
decisions following the 
expulsion of its troops from Kuwait early last year. 
    The summit broke no new ground on steps to achieve a Gulf common
market, but called on 
officials to present a plan for common external tarrifs for all six
members to the next 
summit which will be held in Saudi Arabia in December 1993. 
    The statement stressed that developing relations between the Gulf
Arab states and Iran 
""is linked to enhacing confidence and to measures Iran might take in
line with its 
commitment to the principle of good neighbourliness and the respect of
the sovreignty and 
territorial integrity of the region's states."" 
    It denounced Iran's measures on the island of Abu Musa, which it
shares with the 
United Arab Emirates, and the continued occupation of the smaller
islands, the Greater and 
Lesser Tumbs. 
    It expressed deep regret and extreme concern for the unjustified
Iranian measures 
which contradict a proclaimed wish to develop relations and called on
Iran to rescind 
those measures and end the occupation which it said was ""shaking peace
and stability in 
the area."" 
    Iran earlier this year extended its control over Abu Musa beyond a
small garrison it 
established there in 1971 under an agreement with the UAE emirate of Sharjah. 
    It has since rescinded orders expelling foreigners who worked on the
island for the 
UAE government but diplomats in the region say that its security forces
continue to 
exercise their authority over the whole island. 
    The UAE has seen this as virtual annexation. 
    The Tumbs were occupied by the former Shah of Iran in 1971 and the
UAE has since the 
Abu Musa crisis erupted insisted that they have to be returned as part
of a general

RTw  12/26 1441  IRAN HINTS IT READY TO GO TO WAR OVER ISLANDS 

 (Eds: updates with SNSC statement) 
    NICOSIA, Dec 26, Reuter - Iran told its Gulf Arab neighbours on
Saturday it was ready 
to defend militarily three disputed islands, reminding them of its
eight-year war with 
Iraq. 
    ""Our eight-year defence (in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war) has proved to
the world that 
our brave nation will never hesitate to defend the sovereignty and
safeguard the 
territorial integrity of Iran,"" Iran's Supreme National Security Council
(SNSC) said. 
    A meeting of the heads of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council
voiced full support 
on Wednesday for the United Arab Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran
over the Gulf 
islands of Abu Musa, Greater Tumb and Lesser Tumb. 
    The move has triggered strong Iranian criticism and warnings.
Besides the UAE, the GCC 
also groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar and Saudi Arabia. 
    Iranian President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, who chaired the SNSC's
meeting on 
Saturday, said during his Friday prayer sermon at Tehran University:
""Iran is surely 
stronger than the likes of you. To reach these islands one has to cross
a sea of blood."" 
    The SNSC, quoted by the official Iranian news agency IRNA received
in Cyprus, also 
criticised the GCC and described its support of the UAE as ""irresponsible."" 
   ""No country will ever be able to covet even an inch of Iranian soil,""
said the SNSC. 
    Earlier on Saturday, the English language Tehran Times, believed to
be close to the 
Foreign Ministry, said the UAE should be aware that Iran's
self-restraint had certain 
limits. 
    It dismissed a UAE claim to the islands as unfounded and said a 1971
agreement to 
share Abu Musa with the UAE emirate of Sharjah still applied. 
    ""The idea of Abu Dhabi officials that Tehran would always refrain
from responding to 
the blows inflicted by them was ""childish,"" Tehran Times said. 
    IRNA said the newspaper was commenting on the GCC statement which
urged Iran to 
reverse what it says is the annexation of Abu Musa island and to pull
out of the two other 
islands. 
    Iran says the islands near the entrance to the Gulf have
historically belonged to it. 
The dispute flared this year after Iran tightened its control over Abu Musa.

RTw  12/28 1011  TEHRAN PAPER WANTS IRAN REVIVE CLAIM TO BAHRAIN 

    TEHRAN, Dec 28, Reuter - Radical Iranian newspapers, angered by Gulf
Arab claims to 
three disputed islands, are hitting back with demands that Tehran revive
its claim to 
Bahrain and consider improving ties with Iraq. 
    President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani and senior officials strongly
condemned a statement 
last week by leaders of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) backing the
United Arab 
Emirates (UAE) in its dispute with Iran over the Gulf islands. 
    But the newspapers Salam and Jomhuri Eslami demanded that Tehran go
further than 
restating its resolve to defend its sovereignty over the islands of Abu
Musa, Greater Tumb 
and Lesser Tumb. 
    ""It is not very clear why the Sheikh of Bahrain has joined the
others,"" Jomhuri Eslami 
said. The GCC groups Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. 
    ""If historical records are to be the criterion, the sheikh of
Bahrain should go about 
his own business and the rule of Iranian people in Bahrain, which
belonged to Iran until 
1970, should be re-established,"" the paper said. 
    ""It is fitting for the foreign ministry to raise the question of
Iran's sovereignty 
over Bahrain...and start a serious and effective drive to end the
separation of Bahrain 
from Iran,"" it added. 
    The late Shah of Iran relinquished Iran's claim to Bahrain in 1970,
a year before the 
island became an independent state. 
    Iranian leaders since the 1979 Islamic revolution have carefully
avoided raising the 
Bahrain issue although it is occasionally brought up in the press during
periods of 
tension with conservative Arab states across the Gulf. 
    Salam newspaper said the GCC stand showed that the policy of
appeasing pro-Western 
Gulf Arab rulers had backfired. 
    ""No matter how much you smile at sheikhs on the southern coast of
the Persian Gulf, it 
is the United States and the West which speak the last word,"" it said. 
    ""They (the sheikhs) are nobody,"" Salam said, adding that Iran should
revise its policy 
towards its neighbours, especially its former war enemy Iraq. 
    ""Disregarding the logical potential of expanding ties with
Iraq...and going along with 
some Saudi-backed trends among the Iraqi opposition have played a role
in the formation of 
the current situation,"" the paper said. 
    Ties between Iran and Iraq, which fought a war from 1980 to 1988,
improved briefly 
after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990. 
    But Tehran, which denounced the invasion and remained neutral in the
ensuing war, 
again called for President Saddam Hussein's overthrow when he suppressed
a Shi'ite Moslem 
revolt which swept southern Iraq after his 1991 defeat in Kuwait.

Even though I find this to be funny on the surface, the original poster of the
joke has  tried and convicted the members of the BD to be a bunch of ""nuts"".
This may be a dangerous thing to do.  It is my opinion that most educated
or well informed people of this country have some distrust of the government.
This should exist because as a bureaucracy, any government given enough time
will tend to exist for it self and not for the original purpose it was 
created for.  This distrust by the people should keep those in power in-line.
That and a properly functioning press.  When a sensationalism oriented press
portrays a group of people as ""nuts"" or crazies, a violation of those
people's civil rights seem justified.   Since we, as American's, have the 
gurantee of rights as enumerated in the constitution, to include the
2nd ammendment, the government must appease the public's opinion or risk 
voted out of existance, or if it has become corrupt enough to tamper with
domocratic process itself, being thrown out by force.
  Our government as it stands, must appease the public.  Therefore the 
official press releases portray the BD's as fanatics who are a threat to
public safety.  We must not prejudge people based on one sided information.
So far the only information that we are being given is comming from the very
agency that was embarrased by the BD(Branch Davidians sp?).  It is to their
advantage to make the BD's as fanatical and dangerous as possible.  If they
were portrayed as law-abiding citizen's, then they(ATF) had no justification
what so ever of doing what they did.
   So let's keep an open mind.  Jokes like above, even though it may be funny,
may mislead the public from the truth of the matter.

Just as an aside,  my understanding of U.S. vs Rock Island and U.S. vs Dalton
leads me to believe that the National Firearms Act, which allows the Fed's
(in this case ATF) to regulate firearms(machine guns), has been deemed to be
unconstitutional since 1986.(By two federal district courts at least).
And since, I believe the only reason ATF was involved
in this case is because of firearms violations, it would be interesting to 
find out whether or not the search warrent was based on the NFA.
It would be very embarrassing indeed if a search warrent based on a possibly
unconstitutional law has resulted in 4 deaths(Law enforcement).

There is a convention called a `smiley', which looks like this:   :-)  .
It is supposed to look like a sideways smiley-face, and indicates that the
preceding comment is supposed to be funny.


And, I'll note that I have participated on talk.religion.misc for over
five years -- I'd say Mr Siemon was not too far off.  8^)

In the meat of his reply, Mr Boundary serves up an excellent example of what
I meant by ""There is no way out of the loop"".  I wrote that human brains ""are
infested with sin"", and can be trusted only in limited circumstances.

In reply, Mr Boundary wrote:

Which just moves the problem back one level: how do you tell if your
conscience is properly formed?

The only way to tell is to presuppose that you are capable of judging the
formed-ness of your own conscience.  In other words, you can only be sure
that your conscience is `properly formed' if you assume that your evaluation
can be trusted.  Assuming your conclusions saves you a lot of time, I'll
grant, but it's not a valid way of reasoning.

Unless you are infallible, your judgements about your own thinking cannot be
certain.  Therefore, it is not possible to be certain your conscience is
`properly formed'.  (Whatever that is supposed to mean.)


Mr Boundary then gives another paradigm example of the problem:

The Church is `by necessity' the infallible interpreter of divine revelation?
How do you know?  Presumably, you believe this because of some argument or
another -- how do you know that the argument contains no mistakes?

You write:

But there is a huge difference between `confidence in our ability to
distinguish what is true from what is not true' and `infallible'.  I am
confident about a lot of things, but absolute certainty is a very long way
from `confident'.

This discussion is about the arrogance of claiming to be absolutely certain
(really, go check the subject line).  Saying you are absolutely certain is
significantly different than saying you are confident.  When you say that
you are confident, that invites people to ask why.

Except in very limited circumstances, when you say that you are absolutely
certain, it invites people to dismiss you as someone who does not have any
idea of his own fallibility.


I have yet to meet anyone who believed in a knowably-infallible source of
truth who would admit the possibility of errors in his reasoning.  All of
them -- every last one -- has claimed that he was himself infallible.
The result has been to convince me that they had no idea what was going on.


Darren F Provine / kilroy@gboro.rowan.edu

[This particular discussion may not be entirely relevant to the
original criticism.  I get the feeling that the original poster
regarded as arrogant the very idea that there are right and wrong
answers in religion, and that the difference can have eternal
consequences.  When I say that I think there is a hell and that he is
at least in significant danger of ending up there, I will admit that
-- as you say -- the reasoning processes I used to reach this are
fallible.  Thus at least in principle I could be wrong.  But these
basic facts are clearly enough taught in the Bible that I think it's
unlikely that I'm misinterpreting it.  (In order to get this level of
confidence, I've tried to frame my statement sufficiently carefully as
to sidestep a number of the more controversial issues.  I haven't, for
example said that all non-Christians will definitely end up in hell,
and I haven't attempted to describe hell in any detail.)  I have a
feeling that my view is going to be regarded as arrogant and
intolerant even though I acknowledge that I'm fallible and so there's
some chance I'm wrong.

Don't get me wrong -- I think there are a lot of genuinely arrogant
Christians, and often criticism of us is justified.  But in at least
some cases I think the criticisms constitute blaming the messenger.
If the universe is set up so that there are eternal consequences for
certain decisions, it's not my fault -- I'm just telling it the way I
think it is.  You may think God is immoral for setting things up that
way.  It's one of the critiques of Christianity that I find it most
difficult to respond to.  But it's not arrogance for me to tell what
I think is the truth.

    non-silicone DOT-5 fluids are now apparently available -- rpw]

                 Commonly Asked Automotive Questions


Tire Questions:

Q:  What do the funny numbers on the sides of my tires mean?

A:  Typically, you will see something like 195/60HR14.  the 195 is the
    overall width of the tire in millimeters, the tread is usually
    narrower.  The 60 is the `aspect ratio'; it indicates the height of the
    sidewall of the tire relative to the overall width.  Our example tire
    has a sidewall height of 0.60 * 195 ~= 117 mm.  The 14 is the wheel
    diameter in inches; there are also some special tires called `TRX'
    tires which have three digit metric wheel diameter designations, like
    390, which is in millimeters.  The R means Radial, and the H is a speed
    rating indicating the highest speed at which the tire, when properly
    inflated and carrying an appropriate load, may safely operate.  Common
    speed ratings are S (112MPH), T (118MPH), H (130MPH), and V (up to
    150MPH.)

    Recent changes to the method for specifying tire sizes move the speed
    rating to a different part of the designation; you may therefore find
    designations like 195/60R14 85H; the 85 indicates the per-tire load
    associated with the speed rating -- exceeding this load in continuous
    operation at the rated speed is dangerous practice.  What follows is
    a table showing a number of `load indices' and corresponding maximum
    per-tire loads:

    Load Index       50   51   88   89   112   113   145   149   157
    Max Load (Kg)   190  195  560  580  1120  1150  2900  3250  4125

    Note that the usual mass vs. weight confusion occurs in this table.

    In some cases, the letters P or LT may be found in front of a tire
    size; the LT designation indicates Light Truck, and the P designation
    indicates Passenger car.  If no letter is given, then the application
    of the tire is Passenger car usage.  As far as I know, these letters
    only appear in the US market.  The LT designation is prinicipally of
    interest to owners of light trucks and other utility vehicles.  For
    the owner of a passenger vehicle, there is no meaningful difference
    between a tire with a P designation and one with no designation at
    all.

    If the aspect ratio is omitted, it is probably 80, but may be 78.

    Tires with an MS (mud/snow) designation may have their speed rating
    reduced by 20 km/h (about 12mph.)

    There is an additional set of ratings on tires for temperature,
    traction, and treadwear.  Temperature and Traction are graded
    A, B, and C (with A the best and C the worst); treadwear is
    a numeric rating.  These values are of limited value, as they
    are assigned somewhat arbitrarily by tire manufacturers and are
    thus not useful in comparing different brands of tires.

Q:  My car has tires with a funny size designation:  185/65HR390; can i put
    normal tires on the car?

A:  Your tires are called TRX tires; they were devised by Michelin.
    Because of a somewhat different bead design, they are incompatible
    with normal tires; Michelin used a different diameter wheel for them
    so that they could not be mounted on the wrong type wheel (and so that
    more conventional tires could not be mounted on TRX type wheels.)
    You will need to aquire different wheels to put a normal tire on your
    car; it is barely possible to fit normal tires on TRX wheels, and horribly
    dangerous to do so (the tires may simply peel off the rims in a corner,
    or possibly blow out at high speed.)  TRX type tires are becoming hard
    to find; in addition to Michelin, Avon makes suitable tires.  Goodyear
    has apparently discontinued their line of TRX tires.

Q:  Can I rotate radials from side to side, or rotate them only on one side
    of my car?

A:  Car and tire manufacturers have differing views on this subject; many
    say that swapping radials between the left and right hand sides of a
    car is now ok (this group includes Michelin and Goodyear); others
    (for example, Pirelli and Nokia) will void warranties if such swapping
    is done.  The best advice is to read your tire manual carefully before
    rotating your tires, and stick to the manufacturer's recommendations.

Q:  How many snow tires should I buy, and if I buy 2, which end of the
    car should I put them on?

A:  In short, 4, and both ends.  To explain, many drivers in areas that don't
    get excessive snow or who don't drive agressively (or at all) in snow
    conditions get away with only two snows on the drive wheels, but there
    are circumstances where this can be dangerous practice.  With a rear
    wheel drive car, you can choose between being able to start the car
    going (a function of the rear axle) or stopping and turning the car
    (a function of the front axle.)  In a front wheel drive car, you start,
    stop, and turn with the front end.  The primary risk of putting the
    snow tires on the front only is that if you have to put on the brakes
    while going downhill, you run a serious risk of going downhill backwards.

Radar Detectors and Speed Limits:

Q:  Why aren't there any comments on Radar Detectors and Speed Limits
    in this Q&A posting?

A:  Because questions about detectors and speed limits crossposted between
    misc.consumers and rec.autos.* always start long, tedious, and pointless
    flame wars.  If you want to talk about either of these topics, please
    subscribe to rec.autos or alt.flame and keep it there.

Safety Equipment:

Q:  Do airbags really work?

A:  Preliminary statistics suggest the following:  Airbags work much
    better than no belts; good 3 point belts alone work much better than
    Airbags alone, and AirBags + 3 point belts work slightly better than
    3 point belts alone.  The con to airbags is that some designs tend
    to burn the driver's hands when venting the byproducts of the
    explosion that occurs inside the bag, and that some designs (but
    not all) may knock the driver's hands from the wheel, making retention
    of control of the vehicle after the bag deflates more difficult.

Brake Questions:

Q:  Do I always need to get the rotors on my disk brakes turned?  Midas
    always wants to do this.

A:  No.  There are specific conditions that mandate turning or replacing
    rotors; some shops try and make a little extra money by replacing rotors
    more often than is strictly necessary.  if the rotors are not warped
    warped, and only lightly grooved, then there is no need to replace or
    to turn them.  Note also that some rotors (the rotors on many Hondas
    are a good example) are so narrow to begin with that it is not practical
    to turn them; they must be replaced when they become too thin, warped,
    or badly grooved.

Q:  They tell me I should downshift when braking to slow my car down.  Is
    this really a good idea?

A:  It used to be a very good idea, back in the days of mediocre, fade
    prone drum brakes.  In modern disc brake equipped cars, use of
    downshifting to slow the car is not really necessary, except in cases
    of long, steep downhill runs.  Otherwise, modern disc brakes are more
    than adequate to stop a passenger car in all circumstances, and they
    are much cheaper to repair than clutch linings.

    On the other hand, many standard driver's license tests in the USA
    still specify that the driver being tested downshift under braking; I
    suggest that before taking a US driver's test, you either 1) learn to
    do this smoothly (which takes some time and practice) or 2) borrow a
    car with an automatic to take the test.

Q:  How often should I replace my brake fluid?

A:  Probably more often than you do.  Traditional brake fluids tend to
    absorb water; this water can corrode internal parts of the brake
    system and also lower the boiling point of the fluid.  DOT-3 type
    are older fluids; DOT-4 and DOT-5 are newer specifications.  The
    principal differences are in wet and dry boiling points; the dry
    boiling point is important in fresh brake fluid, but the wet boiling
    point is important in older brake fluid.  DOT-3 fluids have the lowest
    wet and dry boiling point _requirements_; DOT-4 fluids have better
    boiling point requirements; and DOT-5 fluids have the best boiling
    point requirements (but DOT-5 fluids are not clearly superior; see
    the next Q&A for more details.)  While the requirements imply that
    DOT-4 fluids are better than DOT-3 fluids, there may be specific
    cases where a DOT-3 fluid is preferable, but these are mostly
    competition applications.  Otherwise, DOT-4 type fluids offer _much_
    improved brake pedal feel.  Replacement once a year is recommended for
    DOT-4 fluids, although agressive drivers may profit by changing out
    fluid more frequently, or at least bleeding a modest amount of fluid
    out of the brake calipers fairly regularly.

Q:  What about DOT-5 brake fluids?

A:  This breaks down in to two parts.  The DOT-5 specification looks
    excellent for performance, but the first DOT-5 fluids were Silicone
    based.  Silicone fluids are a tricky proposition.  Unlike DOT-3 and
    DOT-4 fluids, they do not absorb water at all.  While this may sound
    like a feature, the problem is that any water present pools up in
    such systems, interfering with braking performance and corroding any
    metals at the spot where the pooling is occuring.  The water will tend
    to migrate downwards in the braking system to the brake calipers, where
    most of the corrosion occurs.

    Because of this phenomenon, it is essential when converting to
    Silicone to empty the entire brake system and flush it throughly
    beforehand; some even recommend replacing all rubber parts in the
    brake system when converting to Silicone fluids.

    Two other issues that come up with silicone fluids:  1) they are
    difficult to pour cleanly (that is, without air bubbles), which
    interferes with getting a good brake pedal feel, and 2) while they
    generally have much higher boiling points than DOT-4 fluids, they
    do have high temperature failure modes which are indistinguishable
    in effect from boiling DOT-4 fluids.  SIlicone fluids may make sense
    in some street car applications, but they are certainly not
    recommended for high performance driving applications, and the
    economics are questionable for street use.

    I have recently become aware of new fluids that meet the DOT-5 standard
    that do not contain Silicones; these fluids appear to be reasonably
    compatible with the older DOT-3 and DOT-4 fluids, but I have little
    information at this time.

Q:  ABS is available on some of the cars I'm looking at, but it costs
    more.  Is it worth it?

A:  This does not have a cut and dried answer; therefore, this answer will
    be quite long in order to cover the pros and cons.  The short answer
    is that ABS costs more, both initially, and to maintain, will generally
    work better for the `average driver' (that is to say, a driver who does
    not have extensive experience in high performance driving techniques),
    and may require the `unlearning' of some obsolete braking techniques
    like pump braking which should be unlearned in any case.

    Now for the long answer.  ABS works by monitering the wheels of the
    car, looking for signs of locked brakes.  It may or may not be able
    be able to distinguish between the different wheels (there are several
    systems on the market.)  It cannot detect impending lockup (which is
    what you would really want in an ideal world), but only the existence
    of lockup.  The sensors used vary; some of the less well designed
    sensors are sensitive to tire size, and to brake pad material, and
    may cease to function properly if the owner deviates from original
    equipment or OE-equivalent components.

    When the sensors detect lockup, the ABS system responds by unlocking
    the brakes (either individually, or all at once, depending on the
    system.)  If the driver keeps their foot firmly planted, the ABS
    will end up cycling between the locked and unlocked states (if a
    sensor existed that could detect _impending lockup_, then we could
    sit right at that point, which is where maximum braking effect is
    achieved.)  This pulsing can often be felt in the brake pedal, as
    the system cycles.  The percentage of the time that the brakes are
    truly engaged is called the `duty cycle'; typically in an ABS system
    this is about 40%  On dry pavement, a trained driver can beat this
    duty cycle quite reliably using a technique called threshold braking;
    on wet pavement, braking is so chancy that ABS will outperform
    threshold braking nearly every time.  Unfortunately, on mud and on
    snow, often maximum braking effect can be acheived with the brakes
    locked; only Audi, of the manufacturers producing ABS-equipped cars,
    has seen fit to provide a disable switch for the ABS system for this
    eventuality.

    A particularly important feature of ABS is that it preserves
    steering control.  This is the case simply because, if you are
    braking near the limit and turn the wheel, the ABS will release
    the brakes if it sees steering-triggered lockup, and back off
    on the percentage of the time that the brakes are applied.
    Braking distances will lengthen accordingly.

    An important caution:  ABS cannot exceed the maximum theoretical
    braking force in any given situation; if you start sliding on
    glare ice, don't expect an ABS system to help you out very much.
    The coefficient of friction is not changed by the presence of an
    ABS system in your car.

    As far as maintenence goes, in addition to the potential
    restrictions I've listed above, you have to worry about the
    following:  1) parts costs are much higher; the OE master cylinder
    for my obscure european sedan lists for $185, but the OE master
    cylinder for the ABS-equipped version of the same car lists for
    over $1000.  Most manufacturers explicitly forbid use of DOT-5
    (silicone) brake fluids in ABS-equipped vehicles.  Because of
    the potential cost of replacement of corroded brake system
    components, regular (I suggest annual) replacement of brake fluid
    becomes very important.

Q:  What about this threshold braking business?

A:  [normally, I'd not put this in the consumers Q&A, but recent
    publicity about a number of accidents involving police drivers
    in ABS-equipped Chevy Caprices suggests that this section is
    needed here -- rpw]

    Threshold braking is a technique practiced by all serious high
    performance drivers; if made a habit, it replaces the `stab
    the pedal and lock 'em up' panic habit entirely, and is much
    to be prefered.  Basically, the premise is that tires generate
    maximum braking force when they have just started to slide, but
    just before the wheels lock up entirely.  Drivers who threshold
    brake learn to feel what this `threshold' feels like, and learn
    to search for it and hit it on the application of the brake
    pedal.  In many cars, you can feel that you are near the
    threshold when the pedal starts to firm up as you depress it.
    In any case, if you can't hear the tires whine just a bit, you're
    not very near the threshold.

    In a car with ABS, often there is a twinge in the pedal just
    before the system starts cycling; if the driver backs off on
    the pedal just a tad when the twinge is felt, then they are very
    close to the threshold and they'll probably achieve better
    stopping distances than if they just punched it and let the ABS
    take over.

    Recently, there has been a rash of publicity over a number of
    accidents, and one death, involving police cars equipped with
    ABS systems.  The police departments in question quickly blamed
    the new ABS systems, but according to Autoweek magazine, it now
    seems clear that the problem was a lack of training; none of the
    involved officers had any recent performance driving training.
    There is reason to believe that the drivers reacted to the pulsing
    brake pedal by `pump braking', an old and discredited technique
    of stabbing and releasing the brake pedal, the goal being to
    try and get brakes back with a failing hydraulic system.  If you
    think about it for a minute, you'll realize that pump braking must
    cut the effective operation of a working brake system by at least
    1/2, so if you cut the 40% duty cycle of an ABS system by that
    much, you are giving up most of your brakes for the wrong reason.
    Threshold braking has the advantage in that it is an effective
    and useful technique regardless of whether your car has ABS; if
    you do fear a failed hydraulic system, then one or two stabs at
    the pedal will be sufficient.    

Gas Questions:

Q:  Does High Octane gasoline help?

A:  Maybe, maybe not.  Some cars have knock sensors, and can adjust the
    engine timing or turbocharger boost to suit the gasoline being used.
    On most cars, however, you should use the cheapest gas that makes your
    car run well.  Check your owner's manual for details on what your car
    needs.

Q:  My car was made for leaded gasoline.  Will unleaded gas hurt it?

A:  It is possible that unleaded gas may *slightly* increase valve wear,
    although the Amoco Oil company argues otherwise.  The actual increase
    in valve wear will be almost unnoticeable, however, as modern leaded
    gasolines actually contain very little lead.  You should, however,
    check your owner's manual; many cars from the early 1970s do not
    actually require leaded gasoline.

Q:  Do fuel treatments help?  What kind should I use?

A:  Some do and some don't.  During the winter, it is a good idea to use
    dry gas; however, some may be harmful to fuel injection systems.
    Never use an additive containing Methanol (sometimes called Methyl
    Alcohol); such additives may damage fuel systems in cars with carbs
    and almost certainly will damage cars with fuel injection.

    Manufacturer's opinions vary on additives containing Ethanol (sometimes
    called Ethyl Alcohol); if your car has fuel injection, check the owner's
    manual on your car before  using these.  Most manufacturers consider
    10% Ethanol acceptable in gasoline.  Additives with Isopropyl Alcohol
    (Isopropanol), and Petroleum  Distillates are fine in fuel injected
    cars.

    An occasional bottle of fuel injector cleaner is helpful in cars with
    fuel injectors, although many premium gasolines contain detergents that
    do the same job.  Some off brands of fuel injector cleaners contain
    Ethanol or Methanol; always check the ingredients before putting anything
    in your gas tank.

    There are a small number of particularly good additives; these are
    noticeably more expensive that the run-of-the-mill ones, but work
    much, much better.  Among these are Chevron Techron, Redline SL-1,
    Wurth `Lubrimoly Ventil Sauber', and BG 44K.  A bottle of one of these,
    once every six months, is highly recommended.

Q:  What about detergent gasolines?

A:  The quality of detergent packages in gasolines varies somewhat; BMW
    has instituted a testing program, and gasoline brands which pass this
    test may advertise that fact.  Stickers indicating passage of the test
    are now beginning to appear on fuel pumps at gas stations.  If such
    gasolines are used, then fuel injector cleaners are probably optional.
    Beforewarned that while use of BMW approved gasolines will keep a clean
    engine clean, they may not clean a motor with bad valve deposits.

Lubrication Questions:

Q:  What do the numbers and letters in a motor oil designation mean?

A:  There are several different items encoded.  There is a two-letter
    code indicating the type of detergent package that the manufacturer	
    uses in the oil; this looks like SE,SF,CD or such.  The S codes are
    for gasoline engine applications; the C codes are for diesel engine
    applications.  The second letter is assigned in sequence as new levels
    of protection are developed; thus SF is considered better than SE,
    SE is considered better than SD, and so forth.

    The more noticeable designation is the oil weight.  This is either
    a single number (e.g., 30 weight) or a pair of numbers separated by
    the letter W (e.g., 10W30.)  The latter type is much more commonly
    used these days, and are the only type that most automobile
    manufacturers specify in operators manuals.  The first number in the
    designation (10W) is the apparent viscosity of the oil when it is cold;
    the W stands for `winter'.  The second number (30) is the viscosity
    of the oil when hot.  There is a trick here; the oil doesn't actually
    get thicker (turn from 10 weight to 30 weight) as it gets hotter.  What
    is actually happening is that when the oil is cold, it has the viscosity
    of a cold 10 weight oil.  as it gets hotter, it doesn't get thin as fast
    as a 10W oil would; by the time it is up to temperature, it has the
    viscosity of a hot 30 weight oil.

    Note that these numbers actually specify ranges of viscosities; not
    all 10W oils have exactly the same viscosity when cold, and not all
    30 weight oils have the same viscosity when hot.  Note also that the
    novel behaviour of multi-grade oils is caused by additives, and it has
    been reported that with the sole exception of Castrol GTX, 10W40 oils
    do not retain their multi-grade characteristics well over time.  10W30,
    15W40, and 20W50 oils work very well, though.

Q:  Are `quick lube' places any good?

A:  Some do adequate work, but there are quite a few incompetent ones out
    there.  Let the buyer beware, watch them while they work, make sure
    that they don't overtorque the oil drain plug, and keep your hand on
    your wallet at all times.

Q:  Are oil additives like Slick-50 or Tufoil any good?

A:  Slick-50 and Tufoil are PTFE-based additives.  Many of these have
    come onto the market recently; they are different from the moly-based
    additives that have been around since the early 50's.  PTFE is the
    chemical name for Teflon(TM), a trademark owned by DuPont. In general,
    auto manufacturers do not recommend use of these products.  Most USENET
    responses to questions on these additives are favorable (slight
    increase of MPG after application, smoother revving) but long term
    results (whether PTFE additives are effective after 5K miles) are
    debatable.  Some manufacturers (such as Saab) claim that either the
    product or the engine flush that preceeds application causes
    deterioration of the oil seals and eventual leakage.  Some BMW owners
    have reported death of valve seals shortly after the addition of
    Slick 50 to their cars.  This writer has been cautioned by a Slick-50
    Dealer (!) that Slick-50 should _not_ be used in Japanese motors, as
    it may clog the oil return passages in the engine.  Otherwise, there are
    no known reports of damage caused by PTFE additives.

    On the other hand, there are satified Slick 50 customers in the world.

Q:  Do synthetic oils really work?

A:  Yes, but.  More specifically, most auto manufactuers accept synthetics,
    but disagree with the extremely long oil change intervals claimed by
    oil manufacturers.  Auto manufacturers recommend that you continue to
    change oil at the intervals recommended in the owners manual for your
    car.  Even if you decide to try the longer intervals, at least change
    the oil filter at regular intervals, as synthetics get just as dirty
    as conventional oils.

    Synthetic gear lubricants for manual transmissions are another matter
    entirely; Amsoil, Redline, and AGIP are very highly regarded and very
    effective.  Mobil 1 synthetic gear lube gets mixed reviews, however.

Q:  Manufacturers are specifying longer and longer oil change intervals.
    How often should I change my oil?

A:  It depends on how you drive.  If your car always (or nearly always)
    gets warmed up, and you don't drive it very hard and keep the revs
    down, the manufacturer's recommendation is probably fine.  If, however,
    you drive it hard, drive it at high revs, or alternatively, if you
    only drive it to and from the supermarket so that it doesn't get up
    to temperature, then you may wish to change oil much more often,
    perhaps at 3000 mile intervals (given that most manufacturers are
    now specifying 7500 mile intervals.)  If you don't drive your car
    much at all (say 7500 miles a year), then you probably want to change
    oil every six months anyway.  If you are storing a car during the winter,
    then change oil before storing it and change oil when you bring it out
    of storage.

Misc. Questions:

Q:  My car has a timing belt.  I hear that bad things happen when they
    break.  What's the story?

A:  It depends on the internal design of the motor.  Early Ford Escorts,
    for example, will suffer severe valve damage if the belt breaks, but
    the newer cars will just require a tow and installation of a new belt.
    Some Honda motors will not be damaged, but others will be.

    If no replacement interval is specified for your car, then change the
    belt at least every 60,000 miles; some cars may require more frequent
    replacement.  Ask your dealer or independent mechanic.  Also, ask if
    there are any related repairs that should take place at the same time
    (for example, the same Ford Escorts that suffer valve damage also have
    a timing belt driven water pump, which has been known to seize,
    destroying the timing belt, and which then causes major valve damage
    as a side effect.  Replacing the timing belt while ignoring the water
    pump can be a costly mistake.)

Q:  Why would anyone be stupid enough to design a motor so that it
    self destructs when the timing belt breaks?

A:  For performance reasons.  Compromising piston design so that the
    valves and pistons will not collide requires that the compression
    ratio of the engine be reduced significantly; this is why you are
    more likely to avoid valve damage in economy cars than in performance
    oriented vehicles.

Q:  What causes Unintended Acceleration?

A:  The final report of the National Highway, Transportation, and Safety
    Administration concluded that unintended acceleration could not be
    caused by any mechanical failure of the vehicle in question and at the
    same time be consistent with the physical evidence.  The NHTSA report
    goes on to conclude that `pedal misapplication' by the vehicle operator
    is probably the cause.

Does anyone really believe the Swiss have had no war within their borders
because every adult male owns a rifle? I'm a great admirer of the Swiss, but
500 years of peace on their turf has zilch to do with gun ownership. Can you
picture Hitler, with Panzers and Focke-Wulfs poised on the border, losing
sleep over a few thousand expert rifleman? Sure. 
Hitler stayed out of Switzerland because the Swiss run the money in this
world. We'd do well to emulate them on that and forget about getting more
rifles on the street. Let's disband the NRA and start a National Investment
Banking Association, replete with red and black sticker for the back window
of Bubba's Mercedes 600! We could fire Charlton Heston and get Paul Volcker
for a spokesman.

Top Ten Ways Slick Willie Could Improve His Standing With Americans



10. Institute a national sales tax to pay for the socialization of
    America's health care resources.

9.  Declare war on Serbia. Reenact the draft.

8.  Stimulate the economy with massive income transfers to Democtratic
    constituencies.

7.  Appoint an unrepetent socialist like Mario Cuomo to the Suprmeme Court.

6.  Focus like a laser beam on gays in the military.

5.  Put Hillary in charge of the Ministry of Truth and move Stephanopoulos
    over to socialzed health care.

4.  Balance the budget through confiscatory taxation.

3.  Remind everyone, again, how despite the Democrats holding the
    Presidency, the majority of seats in the House, and in the Senate,
    the Republicans have still managed to block his tax-and-spend programs.

2.  Go back to England and get a refresher course in European Socialism.

1.  Resign, now!

       I am contending that there is no state in the Union which does
not have ample wealth, if they choose to spend it, to run a perfectly
acceptable Education system.  (I further contend that the amount of money
being spent now is more then sufficient, but is being spent badly.)

is to blame.  Democrat and Republican alike.)

       Most of our worst areas are still better off than most of Europe.
In any case, we're talking about *education*.  

>If the industry in an area collapses

       Yes, I live in once such area.  You're woefully ignorant of the
situation.

       At the same time some of Tennessee's school districts are closing
down, the Governor asked for 7.5 million dollars for bicentenntial
celebration license plats.  In almost the same breath he wanted to raise
unemployment compensation and reduce taxes which paid into it.
 
       I don't know about the rest of the country, but *our* education
problems stem directly from two problems, neither of which are a lack
of money in the state.  (BTW, Tennessee is considered a ""tax heaven""
and our economy is one of the strongest in the country.  *I* see
a correlation.)  1)  What money we spend goes primarly to administration.
The average administrator makes two and a half times what the average
teacher makes, and sucks up an enormous amount of revenue.  And 2)
the Governor is making a concerted effort to create an ""Education crisis""
in order to push for his pet income tax.  Some of the most idiotic
programs get funded (like State funds for new art in the county seat)
while schools are closing.  It's not a lack of funds.  It's an
unwillingness to spend them on what is more appropriate.  Education
is *the* parental hot-button.  Education is *always* the first to
but cut, because it's easier to get people to pay for their children
than ugly art.

      They did it anyway.  The Continental Congress had its own set of
bylaws.  It wasn't quite a government, but a means of making decisions
had to be created.  (However low George Washington's opinion of them were.)

      Allow me again to speak heresy against the Holy Democratic Orders.
So what?  The government was built with a very non-democratic Presidency
with fairly broad powers, including the veto.

>It has not only

      Yes, and the Senate was intended to act as a balance to this.
Too much democracy was intentionally avoided.  It was considered a good
thing to place non-democratic blocks to impulsive action.

      So long as Congress has something to sell, people will pay for
it.  Most congressmen rake in more money than they need.

       No, if the ""progressives"" don't want the ""reactionaries"" to move
backward, they get the same benefit.  41% of the states is a *lot* of
people.  And historically laws with that sort of minority arent'
very effective, especially since it is usually geographically
concentrated.
       When wielding the Federal Big Stick I don't see why they shouldn't
have to make a better argument than, ""more people than not,"" agree.
       
>Now we know why nobody calls the Republicans democrats.

       I'm not a Republican.  I'm a republican.  :-)
       
       And no, I'm neither a Democrat nor a democrat.
       
       Now, I've asked several times, and all you've done is answer
""It isn't democratic,"" which I knew before I said it.  Why *should*
it be democratic?  We don't have a true direct democracy, and few
people advocate one.  Why, then, is this other modification of
democracy to bias it against action so much worse?

Once more around the racetrack. See the original statement that it is
nonsense to believe that you cannot legislate morality. I simply stated
that they can pass all the laws they want but not a single one of them
will make you or I more moral people. They may make us act in a moral
manner, but our actions are only a reflection of the unwillingness to
risk punishment. They say nothing about whether we have become more
moral or not. Perhaps the distinction is too fine.

As I understand things, this is just a matter of perspective. If you are
on the outside looking in, it appears that nothing can ever enter the
black hole; as something approaches the event horizon it appears to slow,
and never gets there. However if you are on the object looking out you
get an entirely different view. As you look out you will see the universe
speed up, and ultimately will witness the collapse or heat death of
the universe without.

I agree with you about the upgrade path; but I think I was fair.

The original posting complained (1) about SGI coming out with newer (and
better) architectures and not having an upgrade path from the older ones,
and (2) that DEC did.

On statement (1), I merely attempted to point out that all computer
companies are constantly attempting to improve their product (& market
position/share).  In so doing, they eventually come to a point where they
have a new architecture, and the only upgrade path is to replace the
system.  And the particular system he was complaining about was (in
computer lifetimes) relatively old.

On statement (2), I felt DEC's history of providing upgrades was not far
superior than the industry ""average"", and that, in my opinion, SGI's
history is better than DEC's.

(And what is DEC doing with it's MIPS based DECstation line?  Are they
going to ""abandon"" it for their Alpha based line, or provide an upgrade
path to R4400's and TFP's and R5's?)

Clayton, my man...

You are a tad out of touch....

First, gay comunities all over the country are in the process of excluding NAMBLA
from parades etc.

#2

Nobody from NAMBLA is gonna get a job in a day care centre.  The same liberals you are
upset about are also passing laws that make tough background checks for childcare
people.

#3

Tell me, how would you feel if your employer fired you for your antigay post on the
internet?  Would you be upset ?  I`ll bet you would be pissed!
To some, your posts ,ight make the company look bad.
While your posts offend me I dont think it would be right for you to get fired over
it.

I dont believe the gay comunity is asking for hiring quotas like the affirmative
action laws of the 60's did.
My understanding is that the gay community just wants the same rights the srtraights
have.  I dont think people should have their leases cancelled when their landlord
finds out they are gay.  I dont think that when someone sees someone walk out of
a gay business and then blabs it all over work that the gay person gets fired.
Do you REALLY think these are justified ?

#4

Clayton, I am told you are a parent a couple times over.
Have you been following the strip in the paper ""For Better or For Worse"" ?

I honestly want your opinion as a parent on the strip.  

Do you really care about your childeren
as much as friends of mine tell me ?  How much do you care about your childeren ?
How much do you care about other people's childeren?  Do you care about MY childeren?
Do you care about my sister's childeren ?

If one of your kids told you he/she was gay, would you throw them out of your home
in the middle of the night?

Would you approve of your childeren driving down to San Francisco to trow bottles
at and beat up on gay people?  Would you condone your childeren beating up on someone
elses childeren ?


I await your answers to these queastions.  PLease no flaming...
This is to be a civilised discussion, from one father to another.

I can buy a DES keysearch machine off the shelf now for approx $500K, but
it is not sold by that name. Go buy a circuit emulation machine (eg. Quickturn)
containing a bunch of FPGAs, (say 500 to 1000 3090's), and program each
to be a DES search engine. Lets say 500 chips, running at 10Mhz = 5G tests/sec.
Time is 14e6 sec max = 23 weeks, 12 weeks average. Can't wait that long?
Buy a bigger machine.

Unfortunately, that is the way the league is heading... You can't fight,
so the only way to retaliate against someone is with a cheap shot when
the ref isn't looking. Ulf has brought this to a high level... Players
stuck in the past (like Neely) who prefer fights to cheap shots
are at a disadvantage in the new system.

Lets face it, A cheap shot (like high sticking) is a very effective
method... It is easier to hide from the refs, has a better chance of
causing injury, and you can draw people into fights that way. I don't
like it, but that's the way the league is going.

By the way, there was a rather good hit by Ulf in the last Penguin-Devil
game. Managed to hit the NJ player in the face with a stick. (Must have been a
legal hit... After all, Ulf is a clean player and is allowed to do
things like that.)

I agree.  This is the danger I see, not the system itself.  That is to say,

Now I wouldn't be the one to claim that you are injecting some
disinformation into the net, Andrew, but 'paranoia' refers to
unwarranted or excessive suspicions or fear, not those that
have reasonable roots.

Let's start with looking at the professionals, the NSA itself.
Its birth was by secret executive order by Harry S Truman
in 1952.  Until even 1976 not even one word of this executive
order chartering the NSA was sealed.  Paranoia, right?

On the outside of the NSA complex is a ten foot Cyclone fence
with multiple rows of barbed wire, with high voltage, complete with signs
prohibiting even making sketches under penalty of the Internal
Security Act.  The area is completely scanned by closed circuit
television.  More paranoia.

These are professionals,  Maybe they know something we don't, eh?

Do you think it would have helped Admiral Yamamoto if the Japanese
had been a little more 'paranoid' of their purple cipher?

Or maybe the Germans should have been a little more 'paranoid' about
their Engima with respect to Turing and the British.

How about the cracking of the Zimmerman telegram?  Would a little
more paranoia have helped the Germans here?

Maybe the NSA should have been a little more 'paranoid' about
Emma Woikin, or Joseph Sidney Petersen, Jr., or  ...

Maybe you want to talk about Macmillan publishers cooperation
with the CIA and NSA to suppress Yardley's Japanese Diplomatic
Secrets or even Kahn's The Codebreakers.. paranoia, right?

The most popular cipher systems in captured soviet spies was
the one-time pad, even with the necessity of keeping incriminating
evidence about, is known to be the only proven unbreakable system.
Soviet paranoia, right?

And what do you think the NSA does with its Wullenwebers?  And 
huge Rhombics pointed embassy row?  And their sites near
satellite uplink and downlink sites?  Duh.

When I worked in a classified MITRE communications lab at one time
even with a ""secret"" clearance I had to be escorted to the toilet
and the entire site was built INTO a Mosler-type vault with *very*
thick bomb-proof door.  MITRE paranoia?

I could cite probably a hundred more facts which all support, as
best hypothesis, the notion that the NSA is grabbing as much as
it can, as fast as it can.  One would be a fool to ignore the
pattern of facts and conclude that they were random...

And we know the government is violent -- even against children as
recent events prove.  Judge William Sessions is a disgrace
but a solemn warning to those who ignore the web of evidence
that our government institutions have in their contempt for our
civil rights.

And of course we have to err somewhat on the excessive side of
caution because that does much less harm than erring on the
reckless side. As member of the crew of the USS Liberty might aver.

I might suggest, Andrew, that you read Kahn's Codebreakers and
Bamford's Puzzle Palace and come back with some more facts to
support your sheepish acquiescence to authority.

I would be interested in hearing from anyone who knows of good software for
antenna simulation, particularly in source form suitable for Unix workstations
(though good PC software would also be of interest).
I'm aware of the numerous mininec mutations, and have been using MN for
some time now.  I'm primarily interested in HF, VHF, and low UHF (< 500 MHz)
designs, mostly wire antennas, but for thick wires and mesh surfaces as well
as for your basic thin wire assumption.
Is anything interesting happening with NEC itself?  I've seen a version
that was mutilated to run (sort of) under Microsoft Fortran, but I'm not
sure how many ""new and improved"" versions of the code might be out there
somewhere.
I'd also be interested in non-NEC derivatives.  The ones I've seen have
been aimed at microwave applications, but if there is something out there
useful at the lower frequencies, I'd like to know about it.
Thanks,

I have a few questions about the TAX on  a used car purchase.
I live in New York State, and I am going to buy a used car.
I know that I will have to pay tax when I go to register the car.
But I would like to know of tax is payed on the book value of the car, or
on the purchase price.  Also, what tax rate is used ?  The owner lives in
Albany (8% tax), and I will be living in Saratoga with 7% tax.  
Do I pay Albany tax or Saratoga tax ?  (the difference is a whole $50)
One more thing, how much does it cost for the usual 2 year registration ?

Did I leave anything out ? What else might I have to know to purchase and
register a used car ?  (I've never done this before.)

Thank you,
Peter Volpe

Until recently I always understood the term ""kingdom theology"" to mean the 
theology of the kingdom of God, but now I have discovered that there is a 
new and more specialized meaning. I gather that it is also called ""Dominion 
theology"", and that it has to do with a belief that Christians must create a 
theocratic form of government on earth before Christ will come again.

I have not come across anyone who believes or advocates this, but I am told 
that it is a very widespread belief in the USA.

Can anyone give me any more information about it?

Here are some of my questions:

1. Is it the teaching of any particular denomination? If so, which?
2. Where and when does it start?
3. Are there any particular publications that propagate it?
4. Are there any organizations that propagate it?

Finding a disk array that can do 180MB/sec. will be difficult. The fastest
ones I know about are from Maximum Strategy (IBM also sells these). They
can attach HiPPI at up to 144 MB/sec. (64 bit). For these kinds of data
rates you need more than SCSI for connections. Their latest model, the
RAID 5 model Gen 4 only does 90 MB/sec. but I think this may be a
limitation only of the HiPPI channel and that customer needs have not
exceeded that speed since their older model was faster. They are also not
idle (must be working on newer products that might be faster) and are a
small company so you might be able to ask about custom interfaces. They
still marketed the older, faster model as of a few mongths ago.

Maximum Strategy, Inc.

Milpitas, CA 95035-7408
sales@maxstrat.com

You might still want to look into compression as it will be very difficult
to keep the HiPPI bus fully working at all times - sustained throughput
might come close to maximum burst rate.

Interesting problem. Tell us more if you can?

It's not quite what you were asking, but a few years ago I helped some EE
remote sensing people run some experiments on the microwave emmissivity of
ice; they used the sky for a background calibration source.  They said that
from Earth's surface the sky looks like a 60K blackbody.

Northwest Air tix - SAVE $30 ANY FLIGHT

I have a $400 credit with Northwest Airlines which must be used
by Nov 27, 1993. 

There is a $50 charge to change the ticket, so I will sell it for
$320.  It can be used for any Northwest flight, but I don't think
they will refund cash.

This is the price hockey fans have to pay for the mistake of leaving
ESPN 5 or 6 years ago...it will take time to correct for that mistake.

But returning to ESPN was the correct decision last year...by next
time, we may have the potential for Sportschannel and ESPN to really
compete to offer better coverage and be forced to deliver on it.

I also would like code or algorithms to do this.

In fact, I am interested in sources for code and/or algorithms that
convert 2D graphical objects into other 2D graphical objects that
will render into the same image. i.e. Bezier curves to B splines,
or splines to circular arc segments, or B splines to polgons, etc...

Well, it seems that the Habs have been much talked-about of late, so here's my
$0.02.  These guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the
damn net!!!  Watch them in the offensive zone, especially on the powerplay. 
Damphousse or Lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone, maybe pass to the
point, get it back, skate some more, pass it around....BUT WHERE'S THE SHOT??!
Answer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands
in front of the net a la` Neely, Shanahan, Tocchet, etc etc.  Too bad 
Demers won't put Dipietro or LeClair on the powerplay more often.  Dammit,
even Ewen would at least cause some disruptions.  Montreal desperately needs
a power forward with some talent, IMO.

Then watch them in their own zone. Patrick Roy is screened on everything. Say
what you want about his performance; IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see. 
And Montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net. 
Last night against Washington Roy played a *great* game.  The first goal came
on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I've seen in a long time, and he
didn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.  The second goal came on a
deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway.  Pathetic defence.  The
third goal was EN.

No wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen.

Being wierd again, so be warned:

Is there a plan to put a satellite around each planet in the solar system to
keep watch? I help it better to ask questions before I spout an opinion.

How about a mission (unmanned) to Pluto to stay in orbit and record things
around and near and on Pluto.. I know it is a strange idea, but why not??
It could do some scanning of not only Pluto, but also of the solar system,
objects near and aaroundpluto, as well as SETI and looking at the galaxy
without having much of the solar system to worry about..

I know from personal experience that men CAN get yeast infections. I 
get rather nasty ones from time to time, mostly in the area of the
scrotum and the base of the penis. They're nowhere near as dangerous
for me as for many women, but goddamn does it hurt in the summertime!
Even in the wintertime, when I sweat I get really uncomfy down there. The
best thing I can do to keep it under control is keep my weight down and
keep cool down there. Shorts in 60 degree weather, that kind of thing. And
of course some occasional sun.

Nice, but way over $900....
My point is price/performance  not just performance...

Not necessarily. It is much the same problem as the Eve hypothesis. If
all, or most, of the copies that were available when printing became
common were decended from the same copy, a change in that copy would
propagate to all modern copies, even if there were other copies in 
existence at the time of the change. Very few libraries would have
duplicates of a non-religious book, so there would be few opportunities
for anyone to notice that there were variations. Even if someone did
notice, they would be more likely to copy the variation that conformed
to their expectations and ignore the others.

This won't help if the NSA/FBA axis requires all messages to
undergo textual analysis and reduction to canonical form to
eliminate concealed messages.

After reading several National Computer Security Center
documents, I'm convinced that they are already using this
filter.  DoubleplusgoodNOT.

Well here it goes...my crazy predictions (which never come true, but hey..)

Adams
	Bos vs. Buf - Bos in 5 (cakewalk for the hot Bruins)
	Que vs. Mon - Que in 6 (best series of the first round)

Patrick
	Pit vs. NYI - Pit in 5 (NYI wins fourth game)
	Was vs. NJD - NJD in 7 (a grueling upset, possibly OT in game 7)

Norris
	Chi vs. StL - Chi in 5 (StL is no match for Keenan's Krew)
	Det vs. Tor - Tor in 6 (Clark steps it up in playoffs this year)

Smythe (who cares?)
	Van vs. Win - Win in 7 (so I'm caught up in Teemu-mania, sue me!)
	Cal vs. LAK - Cal in 5 (LA sucks!!!!!!!!! IMO)

Division finals
	Bos vs. Que - Bos in 7 (killer games, watch for Cam to shine)
	Pit vs. NJD - Pit in 6 (NJD go insane, kill all on ice, but Pit wins)
	Chi vs. Tor - Tor in 7 (Tor defense finally get it together)
	Cal vs. Win - Cal in 6 (Win too tired after 1st series)

Conference finals
	Pit vs. Bos - Bos in 6 (Pit too beat up by NJD to play (I hope))
	Cal vs. Tor - Tor in 6 (Vernon turns into a sieve)

Stanley Cup
	Bos vs. Tor - Tor in 7 (Two totally different teams, who knows? Dreams
				can come true, pig might one day evolve wings)

Feel free to laugh at my predictions, I always do!

Lets see if I have this right... HSV == HSB == HSL ... and none of those
are the same as HLS.  Hopefully, HVS is just a transposition of HSV, and
not yet another color model... 

The following code should do the HSV (HSL) coding (I haven't tried it yet)

Another possibility is /mirrors/msdos/graphics/graphgem.zip on

Here is a press release from the White House.

 Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team
April 19; Q&A Following
 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcript
of remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine ""Black
Bears"" NCAA Division I hockey champions:

                           The Rose Garden

 9:58 A.M. EDT

     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's
an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the
winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the
Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell
that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win
a national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.

     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to
win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to
cheer them onto victory.

     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in
size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can
understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.
In our state people are still talking about the time we won the
Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was
back in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine
will as proud of this team as they are today.

     You know, in my state football is a slightly more
popular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)
But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I
can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came
here.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does
have one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish
we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)

     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In
the United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority
Leader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior
Senator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm
actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger
than me.

     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done
a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship
game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I
know a little bit about.

     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams
and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and
Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine
must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a
team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from
behind.

     I think it's important, as I ask young people from
around America who have achieved outstanding things in working
together, to come here to the White House to be recognized and
appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values
and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all
of our lives.

     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have
them here today.  (Applause.)

     (The President is presented with team jersey.)
(Applause.)

     THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful.
(Applause.)

     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)

     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)

                             * * * * * *

     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco
this morning, sir?

     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney
General made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions
to her and to the FBI.

     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it
should be executed?

     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.
That was their judgment, the FBI.

     Q  Is this a raid?

     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --
talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be
done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical
decisions.

     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this
morning?

     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my
quarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).

     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.

     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator
Mitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.

     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?

     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen
this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to
have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to
talk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and
talk some more.

     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your
compromise is no compromise.

     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator
Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for
the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research
indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28
emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan
and Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those
purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people
back to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you


can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position
they're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year
deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time
and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got
to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their
position.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this
kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to
work.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful.
We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good
about it.

     THE PRESS:  Thank you

                                 END       10:10 A.M. EDT

	First of all, I resent your assumption that you know why I
am threatened by science, or even that I am threatened at all,
although I admit the latter.  The reason I am threatened by Science
has nothing to do with my need for proof of my Lord's existence--
God reveals Himself in many ways, including, to some degree,
Science.

	My problem with Science is that often it allows us to
assume we know what is best for ourselves.  God endowed us
with the ability to produce life through sexual relations,
for example, but He did not make that availible to everyone.
Does that mean that if Science can over-ride God's decision
through alterations, that God wills for us to have the power
to decide who should and should not be able to have 
children?  Should men be allowed to have babies, if that
is made possible.

	People have always had the ability to end lives
unnaturally, and soon may have the ability to bring lives
into the world unnaturally.  The closest thing to artificially
created life is artificially created death, and as God
has reserved judgement about when people should die to
Himself, I believe we should rely on God's wisdom about how
people should be brought in to the world.

	This is not to say that I reject all forms of
medical treatment, however.  Treatment that alleviates
pain, or prevents pain from occuring, is perfectly
acceptable, I believe, as it was acceptable for Jesus
to cure the sick.  However, treatment that merely 
prolongs life for no reason, or makes unnecessary 
alterations to the body for mere aesthetic purposes,  
go too far.  Are we not happy with the beauty God
gave us?

	I cannot draw a solid line regarding where I
would approve of Scientific study, and where I would not,
but I will say this:  Before one experiments with the
universe to find out all its secrets, one should ask
why they want this knowledge.  Before one alters the body
they have been given, they should ask themseles why their
body is not satisfactory too them as it is.  I cannot
make any general rules that will cover all the cases, but
I will say that each person should pray for guidance
when trying to unravel the mysteries of the universe, and
should cease their unravelling if they have reason to 
believe their search is displeasing to God.

First of all, the Penguins WILL win the cup again.  Who is going to stop them?
Definitely not the Canucks! 

My predictions:

Patrick Division winner:  Pittsburgh
Adams Division winner:  Quebec or Montreal
Norris Division winner:  Detroit
Smythe Division winner:  Winnipeg

Wales conference champ:  Pittsburgh
Campbell Conference champ:  Detroit

Stanley Cup Champions(again):  Pittsburgh

Canucks suck.  They'll lose in the first round, compliments of Winnipeg
and Teemu Selanne.  

The Pens are almost unstoppable with Mario Lemieux.

Hello WinNetters:

I have seen a great deal of discussion herein on the relative merits of 
MS Access and Borland Paradox/Win.  However, are there any users out there 
with experience with the database package called ""Approach"".  It has gotten
a number of very good reviews from the various mags. and it seems like it
would require less hardware overhead than Paradox.  I have ruled out Access
because some aspects of it are extremely non-intuitive, e.g. requiring a
field to always have a value.  I like what I've seen of Paradox, but it
seems like the resource requirements are greater than what I have (386/25 MHz,
6 MB ram).

So, please provide me with your thoughts are ""Approach"", good and bad.  Thanks.

I wonder if it is possible for a parent window to paint over the area of

YESSS!  You make me proud to
be an 'Merkun.  Good thing you
didn't get shot though. Don't
try that with a good'ole boy in Texas.
I once had a jeep driver south of Conroe cut me off (I was 
in my car) after I had flipped him off for doing something really idiotic
and senseless.  All 280 lbs of him stretches out of his jeep; he walks
back (he is blocking all traffic between Dallas and Houston since the
freeway has been squeezed into a single lane) and says to me, ""Stick that
finger out again and I'll rip it off your hand and shove it down your
sorry-ass throat.""  I stared straight ahead, unblinking.  A hundred
cars were honking.  Eventually he got back into his jeep, face beet-red
with anger, and all the rest of the way back to Houston I tailed him, 
waving, honking, flipping him off, yelling...  I'm glad he decided 
not to shoot me.

Evidently Jim thinks I am arguing an `existence' issue.  It should be clear 
from my response to Bill Rawlins above that in this thread I am objecting only 
to the use of Josephus to validate the messiah claim.  The argument against the
messiah claim is not weak (maybe mine is, but in the hands of pros it is not).

There are indeed two passages.  The short one *cannot be used* to validate the
messiah claim, imo.  That's why I refered to the long, which can be used.  It 
flatly states Jesus ""was the Christ"", and mentions the crucifixion, 
resurrection and Christian belief in said claims.

The short entry mentions Jesus in passing as James' brother - ""... brother of
Jesus, who *was called* the Christ, .... [emphasis mine]"", and that's it. 
If original, Josephus has merely reported what some people say.  It is nothing 
more than an observation, one which lacks the Christian fundamentals.

The long is widely regarded as an insert for three reasons: 1) its way out of
context, 2) Origen evidently knew nothing of it, and 3) its rather inconsistent
with the short.  There is consensus among scholars as defined on the long as 
insert, and I see Jim agrees.  Consensus is usually reflected subtly, as in
Elaine Pagel's _Gnostic Gospels_ (p. 85), ""A comment *attributed* to Josephus
reports ....[emphasis mine]"".  As for #2, I mentioned in my original post that 
the long is a 3rd century insert (more properly, post-Origen as Jim notes).

There may not be consensus on the short.  The text, which discusses James in a
legal role, stands with or without it.  That it does not upset context makes it
difficult to argue insert.  On the other hand, an in-passing insert is easily
disguised in any context.  Nonetheless, on historiographical grounds it is 
worthless for the messiah defense, and that's why I didn't mention it. 

I don't know about the Arabic ms.  If you have a translation reference, Jim,
please let me know.  As for its ""much less gung-ho"" tone, obviously the date 
of this ms. is critical.  If after ca. AD 700, a watered-down entry in lieu 
of removal can be easily explained.

buit have no idea if they will work)
 
2)     I have another ancient device, this one a tape drive for which
the back utility freezes the system if I try to use it.  THe drive is a
jasmine direct tape (bought used for $150 w/ 6 tapes, techmar
mechanism).  Essentially I have the same question as above, anyone know
of an inexpensive beckup utility I can use with system 7.0.1
 
all help and advice appriciated.

   My rule of thumb is ""Don't give rides to people that wear
a bigger helmet than you"", unless your taste runs that way,
or they are family.friends.
Gee,  reminds me of a *dancer* in Hull, just over the river 
from Ottowa, that I saw a few years ago, for her I would a
bought a bigger helmet (or even her own bike) or anything 
else she wanted ;->

	As a stong self-defense advocate, you're 'statement', does littel
but irk me.  Of course shooting someone because they throw a rock at your
car is out of the question, but what if they disabled your car with their
rock and then wanted to come kill/rape/rob/beat/ or otherwise harm you,
your wife, kids?  
	I think you would like the power to defend yourself in this situation,
wouldn't you?  Or is it that you value the lives of such rock throwers
more than your own or those of your family?  
	Don't think it couldn't happen to you.  From the sounds of it here
it has happened to a few people.  

	Please do not misunderstand.  The only justification for using
deadly force on someone, is that if you don't, it will mean your own 
death or grave bodily harm.  I am far far away from supporting
vilante justice or anything like that..

Most likely reason is that your backup battery is failing - this battery 
maintains the contents of the CMOS memory when AC power is turned off, and
if the battery is flakey then the contents of the CMOS will be lost and 
the checksum will be wrong (along with most other of the CMOS data). Try 
replacing the battery.

If, however, your PC doesn't use a battery but a large capacitor to power
the CMOS, you should check to see if you can replace the capacitor with a 
more normal lithium battery. If this isn't possible, make sure you leave
your PC on for a half hour or hour each day; this will keep the capacitor 
charged. I'd opt for the battery change, though.

It's also possible, but unlikely that a rogue problem or even a virus is 
corrupting the CMOS. If your battery seems okay, get a virus scanner and
check out your system.

A very good R&B group came out in 1988 called the Pasadenas.  I bought their
cassette single and fell in love with it.  I've tried to find their LP
or CD but have had no success whatsoever.  Just wondering whether anyone
out in Netland had heard of them....

their song that hit the charts was called Tribute...

 THis is from the same people who make the claim that our minivan is outsellin
theirs.... implying that the Nissan Quest/ Murcury Villager are out-selling
the Chrysler mini-vans.... not only is this not true at all, but it was a stupid
claim to make... the commercial was part of the introduction campaign for the 
vans.  Kind of a bold statement to make when you haven't even sold one yet, eh?

A Yugo that will go 1/4mi in 7.7 seconds will _not_ lose on the
street. That's just too damn quick. It might be wrapped around
a telephone pole at the end of that quarter mile, but it will

Or you could replace the stock shifter with a Hurst short-throw
shifter (available from Ford Motorsport), or any number of other
after-market products to boost the performance of a Mustang or
Camaro. Can you do _that_ with a '93 RX-7, or, verily, with _any_
MR-2? With the Detroit aftermarket, you can build a Mustang or
Camaro which is superior to either car you mention for less than
the sticker price of either.

>Or the Torsen differential of the RX7 compared to the Differential of 
>the 5.0 that sounds in every hairpin turn ?

Well, gee. It works, and it doesn't break. It transmits power to
the drive wheels, and it's essentially zero maintenance--and there's
an aftermarket in parts for Ford and Chevy rear-ends, too.

>And bythe way 5.0 and Camaro both have drums on the rear breaks ...
>Hello , this is the 90 's ?

Well, the '93 Mustang Cobra (which, from all reports, uses the
same running gear as '94 Mustang) has 4-wheel disks. I can't
speak for the new Camaro, but I think it does, too.

Also, stop and think about the markets here. The Mustang is, and
always has been, a mass-market sporty car (that's where the
""pony car"" class came from) with a performance model. That's
why it has the econo-box running gear. That was also factored
into the design of the Mustang from the day Lee Iacocca conceived
his baby; it was designed as a wide-market car--sporty, yet 
accessible--with room for performance tweaking.

The cars you listed are designed for a specific market niche,
and they both fit those niches very well. The Mustang, at least,
does well in multiple markets; I can't speak for the Camaro.

Fine, but one of the points of this entire discussion is that ""we""
(conservative, reformed christians - this could start an argument...
But isn't this idea that homosexuality is ok fairly ""new"" [this
century] ? Is there any support for this being a viable viewpoint
before this century? I don't know.) don't believe that homosexuality
is ""acceptable to Him"". So your scripture quotation doesn't work for
""us"".

Yes the govt handled it in the Rambo Hollywood type style
with extreeme Machismo. Perhaps thats not the way to handle
it. 

It is a completely different thing to start asserting as many
have done that the government is primarily to blame. The comparisons
with the NAZIs in particular are purely gratuitous.

Since you have provided a constructive opinion on the issue your
post desreves to be taken seriously. Peter Nelson also made some
very good points about how a low key approach might have been 
more effective.

The point is though that you learn through mistakes. The govt
played the wrong card and lost. Thats not a big deal. They
had had four guys murdered at the begining and maybee they 
just were not prepared for wuite this situation. Who could be?

If the same thing were to happen all over again we might perhaps
be able to castigate the Govt if they used the same tactics and failed
in the same way. As it is I can't say that I would not have made the
same mistake. Maybee I wouldn't because I don't as a rule go in
for a confrontational situation if I can avoid it. Maybee I would
because with all those press about its very difficult not to try
the macho stuff.


The FBI had information from within the compound we had no access
to. They may have calculated that the B-D followers resolve was
cracking based on their listening devices within the compound. They
knew that Koresh had chickened out of one suicide attempt. This
may have been the reason why they considered that fear might have 
been a weapon for breaking his resolve. Again in Panama they had used
the heavy rock music to great effect during Bush's invasion. Funny that
few of the Koresh supporters and appologists complain much about the
death of several thousand Pananmanian civilians while the US govt attempted
to arrest their former ally.

Koresh negated his civil rights the minute his followers fired
on the police helicopter. No matter whether the warrant was or
was not technically valid the guys who were carrying it out 
thought that it was. Thus the assault on them was completely
inexcusable no matter what rationalisation people might wish to
employ.

Of course we have to consider the guns issue. That is the whole
core of the question. Everything else is a diversion.

Not just because of the riflemen.  They also have many hard bunkers in
the mountains that would be nearly impossible to penetrate. As for

Gee, that's a new one.  He thought it was a different ethnic group.  
Since Hitler was determined to control, at the least, all of Europe,
do you think he gave a damn about international monetary concerns?  
Also, there's a LOT of gold in Swiss vaults.  Don't you think he new
that?  If he could have, he would have taken Switzerland.  However,
crazy as he was, he wasn't totally stupid.  It would have cost him a
hell of a lot to take Switzerland, with no guarantee that an invasion
would be successful.  He probably figured (or his generals did, when
he was listening to them) that it wasn't worth the cost.

If you want to live with someone, you can.
If you don't want to have a civil marriage, don't.
If you don't want to have a wedding in a church, don't.
If you want to call that a marriage, go right ahead.

I hope that the young people that are around you, don't follow your example.

[If the original message claims that marriage is not discussed in the
Bible, I have to disagree.  Various aspects of marriage are discussed
in some of Paul's letters, Ephesians 5 sees marriage as a symbol of
God's relationship with the church.  If it means specifically that the
marriage ceremony isn't described, then that seems to be true.  But I
think what most people mean by Christian marriage is not so much that
it takes place in a church as that the parties undertake the various
commitments to each other that are associated with marriage in the
Bible.  --clh]

Hi!
A while back, there was a thread in this group about the use of the IWII
in Europe (in countries with 50 Hz AC current).  The consensus at the time
was that the IWII would not work there.  As I will be moving there this summer,
I called Apple to make sure and they told me (today) that the IWII (as bought
in the U.S.) will definitely run on 50 Hz AC current (as long as a step-down
converter is employed if 240 V current is used).  The same info, turns out, can
be found in the IWII manual (p. 127 in the 1989 version), but I didn't really
trust that.  Does anyone have any direct experience to the contrary?  Just 
wondering.

From Israeline 4/14

Today's MA'ARIV reports that yesterday, following Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak's meeting with PLO Chief Yasser Arafat and
prominent Palestinian Faisal al-Husseini, the latter said that in
principle, the Palestinians have decided to participate in the
peace talks. Nonetheless, he noted that everything will be decided
upon at the meeting of the Arab foreign ministers in Damascus. The
newspaper also reports that threatening phone calls were recently
made to houses of several of the senior members of the Palestinian
delegation to the peace talks. The threats, in Arabic, demanded
that the delegates not go to Washington to, ""sell out the
Palestinian people."" One caller threatened, ""Should you go, you
will not find your family alive upon your return."" The newspaper
states that such phone calls were received, as far as is known, at
the houses of Faisal al-Husseini, Hanan Ashrawi and others.

That's a good way to put it.  It's a quiet confidence.  I don't feel like
I have to defend this team anymore. 

The Devils are a puzzle to me.  They have long been one of the few teams
I always dreaded playing.  Their D isn't quite what it used to be but they
still usually play us pretty tough.  I just can't figure it out.  At least
last night they mounted an attack.

Bernie Nichols was interviewed after Game 2 on the late news.  He was
shaking his head in disbelief over Barrasso, saying that Tommy is like
another defenseman out there and how difficult it is playing against him.
Then he got this far-away look on his face, his voice started trailing
off and he said, ""It just isn't right...it just isn't fair..."" and he
tried to muster a smile.

As far as coaching goes, a Pens/Islanders match-up should be pretty good.

One guy I feel sorry for in all of this so far is Chris Terreri.  I'm sure
Tom Barrasso knows how he feels.  For so long Tommy would look up and not
have a teammate in sight.  Terreri's teammates really left him out in the
cold in the first two games.

I saw a mask once that had drawings of band-aids, presumably for every puck
that goalie stopped with his face/head.  I can't remember who it was or even
if it was NHL (I see quite a few AHL games here).

This is by far the funniest mask I've seen, and for me funny=cool

Dear Netters,

My sister has an Apple 12"" Color Display hooked up to an LC.

Problem:  There is an annoying, horizontal, ghost-like stripe that 
precesses vertically about once per second.  It is about 1 cm high.
She is in grave danger of going insane because of it.

Any ideas of what it might be and how I might cure it for her?

PS: if I pick up the display (I thought it might be RFI from the LC) it 
seems to get worse!

Claude, I've not heard or read anything that would suggest that vitamin A(
retinol) could reverse hearing loss due to nerve damage(usually caused by 
high sound levels, but also occassionally due to severe infection).  The 
types of cells that vitamin A regulates are the general epithelial cells 
and these cell types are not the ones that function in the ear hearing 
process.  The hair cell nerve-like epithelial cells in the ear may respond 
to vitamin A during cellular differentiation(embryogenesis) but I don't 
know if they are still capable of responding in adults.  If they are 
capable of responding with new hair growth, this would be a very major 
breakthrough in hearing loss.  With all of the medical interest in vitamin 
A, it would not be too surprising if a clinical study was done using 
vitamin A to reverse hearing loss.  But with only a news announcement to go 
on(and this type of communication is notoriously bad), I can't comment on 
your question anymore than I already have.  If one study has been done, 
more will need to follow to firm up a link between vitamin A and hearing 
loss if there really is one.

While I don't read normally read this group, I was looking for Valentine radar
information (sigh, maybe in the FAQ) and came across your posting..

I bought a '93 Probe GT with the PEP 263A last July (now at 9500 miles)
after debating over the Sentra SE-R/NX2000, MX6, MR-2, Stealth, Prelude, 
and Celica.

Check this month's Consumer Reports for previous Probe records.  

My criteria: a ""fun"" car with ABS, airbag, over 130hp, and less than $25K.
I thought about a turbo, but checking with insurance people ruled that out.
The Tri-Star cars (Eclipse/Talon/etc) were out since they don't have an air bag.
Ditto for the Mustang(also no ABS).
The SE-R/NX2000/M20 fell into the pocket-rocket category.  A good used car buy.
The MX-6 was almost there but rolled more than I liked.  
I didn't like the Prelude dash/instrumentation at all.  Too weird for me.
The MR2 has a much smaller non-passenger space than I needed, so out that went.
The Celica was ""ok"" but underpowered when loaded with options (and somewhat
overpriced too) in non-turbo form.
I never considered the 240SX since it didn't have an airbag.  I did look at it
for its RWD virtues but that's it.  The Corolla never entered my mind.
I should have looked at the Mitsubishi VR4/Dodge Stealth more.
Since my list was exhausted, I bought the Probe.  :-)

The car design is different than earlier years, so it's too early to see its
reliability so far.  For what it's worth, my comments:

My dislikes:
Shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal.
Headlights have ""stuck"" up a few times (weather?)
air conditioning broke ~4000 miles (pressure cycling switch)
condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn't drain completely.
crammed engine; little hope for do-it-yourselfers (typical)
parts somewhat more expensive than normal Ford parts
underside plastic doesn't like sharp driveways and speedbumps (typical).
assembly gripes: tape on radiator, screw fell out of dash, seat seams not 
stitched properly.  Hopefully just a fluke.
Ford only gives 1 key with the car.  C'mon Ford, spend an extra few pennies!
Rear hatch has no padding on corners when up.  I'm waiting for the day when
I bash my head on the corner.
horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center (personal preference)
Tires fling dirt/mud onto side of car 

My Likes:
engine (design/valves/sounds/smoothness/power/mileage/torque) -- definitely #1
handling (very good for FWD; understeer only at limits)
transmission (the 5 speed is a must)
usable instrumentation (lovely readable analog everywhere)
Very little torque steer at full power (much better than the '90 SHO I drive)
stability at 100+mph (high gearing though)
low cowl (good visibility in front)
Heated outside mirrors (nice in fog, never tested in freezing weather)
ABS/Air bag (see above)
rear seats fold down (I have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important)
No shake/rattle noises when going over bumps/potholes (still!)
Tires: 225/55VR16 Goodyear Eagles (70% left; hoping for 30K :-)

As you can see, I'm primarily interested in the engine.  While it doesn't
have the uummmph of a big-liter car or the turbo rush, the big selling
point for me was the all-aluminum 24 value 2.5 liter engine.  

The overall car is a good buy for the money.  That market segment hasn't changed
much since July (Prelude VTEC, Honda Del Sol??).  I drive it to and from work
each day on relatively smooth roads, and most noticable thing is that the
Probe's suspension doesn't like potholes.  When you test drive one, find a 
potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable.
If you have 3+ passengers, by all means bring them along too.  They'll find
that they have no room in the back and you'll find that the car rides
differently (if that's ""better"" is up to you).  Also, there's a lot of glass
around you which I wasn't expecting; the temperature inside the car gets pretty
hot in the summer.  My back seat passengers (now very few) complain about
the lack of ventilation; you may want to consider that when combined with
the heat.  I've heard that the exhaust system has trouble, but mine works fine.
Leather and the keyless entry system weren't available when I got the car so
I can't comment on them (I got the car before it was officially announced).  
I prefer cloth to leather anyway.  

I wouldn't want this car in the snow:  The suspension is too rough for the
inevitable surprise potholes, tires aren't meant for snow, and the seats assume
that you're not wearing lots of thick clothing.  Rain is much better:  water 
generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed, the windshield wiper
controls are easy and understandable, and I barely hydroplaned once with the
Eagles (and I was really trying).  
There is also a definite lack of cup holder/small storage places.  The GT
has map holders below the speakers in the door, but they're rigid plastic
that could fit two cassettes or CD's max.  The center console/storage bin/arm
rest has *1* cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth ""pouch""
but that's it.  No change holders.  Quite a let-down from the SHO.
And the Probe is definitely not a people-mover car or an econo-box car!

Lastly, don't store wet car covers in the back.  The foam will soak the 
water up and the result will *not* smell pleasant :-(.

Here's one I hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or
contribution to:

In the State of Virginia radar detectors are illegal, period.  If
you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will
not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine. 
The fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle
(even if it is not on) is $250.00.  Sorry, tourist, ignorance of
the law is no excuse - they will get you too!

It used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for
an officer to actually see the radar detector.  Not any more!  Many
law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors. 
Right, a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up RF
from the radar detector itself.  My first reaction was ""no way!"" 
But, guess again, these little buggers really work and the police
are writing citations right and left for people using radar
detectors.  One news story quoted an officer as saying that he had
found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one,
and he could never figure out where it was - but he knew it was
there.  This tends to make one assume there are few false arrest.

Now, before I get flamed, please understand that I do drive at or
near the speed limit.  I do not need a radar detector to keep me
from getting a speeding ticket.  But, I do like to know when my
speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning.  My radar
detector now stays locked in my trunk when I am in Virginia (which
is what they want - and yes, what the law says, and I intend to
obey the law!) and is only used in states where it is legal.

For my fellow hams, I am not a microwave person - my mind only
works in the HF spectrum between 10 and 80 meters.  Microwave
enlightment may be necessary.

So, the questions are -
  What do the radar detector detectors actually detect?
  Would additional shielding/grounding/bypassing shield stray RF generated by
  a radar detector, or is the RF actually being emitted by the detector
  antenna?
  Are any brands ""quieter"" than others?

While playing around with my Gateway 2000 local-bus machine last
night, it became apparent that Windows 3.1 didn't give the option
for 32-bit access for virtual memory.

I am using a permanent swap file, and the disk drive is on the local
bus interface.

Is this expected, or should I be investigating further why no 32-bit
option appears?

Thanks for any help.

The sensitivity is changed using the /S, /V, or /H parameter.  
The commands do the following:
/V - vertical sensitivity
/H - horizontal sensitivity
/S - both 

Follow the parameter with a number from 1 to 100 (1 - slowest, 100-fastest).
The default is 50.  You can type the command ""mouse /S75"" right from the
keyboard or add it to autoexec.bat.

Sorry, Nelson, but you forgot to ask me. If you check the THN stats for
Kansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having
played in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the
4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.

Well, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn't quite
accurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,
which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because
he knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which
point he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and
he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not
reporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as
injured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped
him down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly
not with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a
no-no).

Very nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was
hurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably
another expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of
his career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players
motivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a
bad judgement call.


>#20	JOHN CARTER		Season: 4th

Always gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but
hustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me
one night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to
hold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's
neck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned
around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter
wasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.

The Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie
McDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me
""you have to make room for the kids"". Carter, in fact, refused to report to
K.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto
retirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockey
now is the Gulls.

Because, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked
fairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn't think he
was quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.

> He should be a solid contender for regular duty next season.

Agreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you
wish they'd performed than how they actually performed. I wonder whether you
can really judge talent from radio and television, Nelson? I know I have
trouble, since you don't see the off-puck action. your views from home and
my views from the ice differ in numerous ways)

You? Nah... 

He was seriously unimpressive, even as a tough guy (his rep). However, as
few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless, I hate
to judge the talent too quickly. Butn in Dody's case, I""m tempted to make an
exception.

But I won't.

Once again, Mark, you don't specify the means through which the government
is to be prevented from becoming the tool of business interests.  As a 
left-wing, big government, conventional liberal, I'm just as willing as
you are to vote against anti-competitive regulations that favor auto
dealers.  

But what I hear from libertarians is a desire to limit incumbents' terms,
to weaken government by eliminating its power to enforce antitrust laws,
and a desire to eliminate legislator's pay.  Each strikes me as a 
particularly ineffective way to insure that auto dealers and other special
interests cannot influence public policy.  In fact, they seem clearly
designed to accomplish the opposite.

The BusLogic cards have an OS/2 2.0 driver that does work with the March 2.1
beta. Support for the BusLogic cards is not included with OS/2 2.0 any longer.
If you wish to install the beta from the CD/ROM, you will need to REM out the
Adaptec device drivers, as they have a nasty tendency to crash the BusLogic
cards when OS/2 attempts to use them. (Thanks Adaptec!) 

So you add the BusLogic drivers to the config.sys on the CD-ROM boot disk, and
REM out the Adaptec drivers.

Then you install the whole 1st half of the Beta.. and it won't work! IBM
nicely copies in the Adaptec drivers once again. (Thanks IBM!) So.. REM out
the Adaptec drivers once more.. and reboot. If you have everything in the
right order.. it will work.

Things are pretty smooth through the rest of the installation.. except OS/2
will try to install the Adaptec SCSI drivers once again at the end... so.. you
are off to more REM statements and more fun. 

The BT 542Bk comes with drivers and costs the same as the Adaptec cards that
do not come with drivers. The DOS drivers work great. This card can easily be
configured to work with 8 different sets of I/O ports (and you can use
multiple host adapters in one machine) If you get a new card.. it will also be
able to support up to 8 GB drives under DOS.

Hope this helps..

Pakistan definitely comes in ambit of the economic colonialism.
The utility rates (electricity, water and gas) are set by IMF and
World Bank. Governments come and go at whims and fancy of the
State Department. I have yet to see a Pakistani govt. survive that
doesnot have the support of the State Department.

I think it's because the lead gets coated with lead oxide if the battery is
not being charged or discharged. I remember some advice from an ancient car
manual guide my father had, which was to use car batteries to power a garage
clock or something similar when they're not in a car. This is supposed to 
prevent the oxidation but I've no idea if it really works. The concrete floor
connection is a red herring.

This may contribute to discharging but would be reversible.

Well, this is off-topic, but back in the days when I used to drive bangers
I never found WD-40 to do anything that wiping with a dry cloth did'nt do.
I think the effectiveness of WD-40 is a myth invented by the guy who owns
the company.

I can't contest the constitutional right to ""bear arms"", but I sort of
draw the line at worshipping them. Can you say ""avodah zarah?""

Meanwhile, back in soc.culture.jewish....
I had expected to see some commentary on the Lubavitcher Rebbe Shlita
announcement that was posted here a while ago. How did it go?

You're assuming that ""go solar"" = ""photovoltaic"".  Solar dynamic power
(turbo-alternators) doesn't have this problem.  It also has rather less
air drag due to its higher efficiency, which is a non-trivial win for big
solar plants at low altitude.

Now, you might have to replace the *rest* of the electronics fairly often,
unless you invest substantial amounts of mass in shielding.

References?  Such treaties have been *proposed*, but as far as I know,
none of them has ever been negotiated or signed.
